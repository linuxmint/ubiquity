+# It is relatively common for the combination of language and location (as
+# selected on the timezone page) not to identify a supported combined
+# locale.  For example, this happens when the user is a migrant, or when
+# they prefer to use a different language to interact with their computer
+# because that language is better-supported.
+#
+# In such cases, we would like to be able to use a locale reflecting the
+# selected language in LANG for messages, character types, and collation,
+# and to make the other locale categories reflect the selected location.
+# This means that we have to guess at a suitable locale for the selected
+# location, and we do not want to ask yet another locale-related question.
+# Nevertheless, some cases are ambiguous: a user who has asked for the
+# English language and identifies their location as Switzerland will get
+# different numeric representation depending on which Swiss locale we pick.
+#
+# The goal of identifying a reasonable default for migrants makes things
+# easier: it is reasonable to default to French for France despite the
+# existence of several minority languages there, because anyone who prefers
+# those languages will probably already have selected them and won't arrive
+# here.  However, in some cases we're unsure, and in some cases we actively
+# don't want to pick a "preferred" language: selecting either Greek or
+# Turkish as the default language for migrants to Cyprus would probably
+# offend somebody!  In such cases we simply punt to the old behaviour of not
+# setting up a locale reflecting the location, which is suboptimal but is at
+# least unlikely to give offence.
+#
+# Our best shot at general criteria for selecting a default language in
+# these circumstances are as follows:
+#
+#  * Exclude special-purpose (e.g. en_DK) and artificial (e.g. la_AU,
+#    tlh_GB) locales.
+#  * If there is a language specific to or very strongly associated with the
+#    country in question, prefer it unless it has rather few native
+#    speakers.
+#  * Exclude minority languages that are relatively unlikely to be spoken by
+#    migrants who have not already selected them as their preferred language
+#    earlier in the installer.
+#  * If there is an official national language likely to be seen in print
+#    media, road signs, etc., then prefer that.
+#  * In cases of doubt, selecting no default language is safe.
+#
+# This code is currently duplicated between here and
+# ubiquity/scripts/localechooser-apply.  Please keep them in sync until the
+# duplication can be removed.
