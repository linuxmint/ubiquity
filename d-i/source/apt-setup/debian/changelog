apt-setup (1:0.80ubuntu1) saucy; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian.  Remaining changes:
    - Install the Ubuntu mirror generator instead of Debian's.
    - Set apt-setup/security_host to security.ubuntu.com, or
      ports.ubuntu.com on ports architectures; adjust directory and
      distribution to match.
    - Add security sources for restricted, universe, and multiverse,
      commented out unless the respective components are enabled. Disable
      security generator checks for contrib and non-free.
    - For CD installs, leave the sources.list created by apt-setup in
      /etc/apt/sources.list.apt-setup, and restore the sources.list created
      during base installation for the rest of the installation.
    - Honour OVERRIDE_BASE_INSTALLABLE when checking
      /cdrom/.disk/base_installable.
    - Set the mirror verification timeout to 30 seconds.
    - Adjust services-select for Ubuntu, removing volatile and adding
      partner (apt-setup/partner) and extras (apt-setup/extras).
    - Always disable the CD at the end of installation if any mirrors are
      present, even if it's a complete CD.
    - Pre-populate apt's lists directory with signed Release files for
      archive.ubuntu.com (and mirrors) and security.ubuntu.com, to protect
      against downgrade attacks right from initial installation.
    - Run 'apt-get update' for all sources.list lines produced by a single
      generator in one go, and don't comment out sources.list lines if it
      fails.
    - Make the path to security updates configurable, as well as the host.
    - Remove restricted from cdrom entry if apt-setup/restricted is false.
    - Make sure apt-cdrom doesn't unmount the CD if cd_type ends with
      /single.
    - Enable all network sources, including security updates, even if the
      network is unconfigured.
    - Honour apt-setup/restricted, apt-setup/universe, and
      apt-setup/multiverse when writing -backports lines.
    - Run 'apt-get update', without downloading package lists or cleaning up
      old files, after moving the sources.list generated during base system
      installation back into place.
    - If OVERRIDE_LEAVE_CD_MOUNTED is set, don't unmount /cdrom; this is a
      bad idea in a live CD environment!
    - Enable backports by default now that we have NotAutomatic enabled and
      working.
    - Add Release files for saucy.

  * generators/01setup: Cope with the case where ROOT is unset.
  * generators/01setup: If apt-setup/multiarch is empty, remove any existing
    foreign architectures (as might have been set up by e.g. a live

  * Support cd_type "bluray". In particular, don't prompt at high priority
    for a mirror to be configured. Closes: #609334
  * Remove hardcoded bail out if the CD filesystem is not iso9660.

    - Honour OVERRIDE_BASE_INSTALLABLE when checking

    - Set the mirror verification timeout to 30 seconds.
    - Adjust services-select for Ubuntu, removing volatile and adding
      partner (apt-setup/partner) and extras (apt-setup/extras).
    - Always disable the CD at the end of installation if any mirrors are
      present, even if it's a complete CD.
    - Pre-populate apt's lists directory with signed Release files for
      archive.ubuntu.com (and mirrors) and security.ubuntu.com, to protect
      against downgrade attacks right from initial installation.
    - Run 'apt-get update' for all sources.list lines produced by a single

      fails.
    - Make the path to security updates configurable, as well as the host.
    - Remove restricted from cdrom entry if apt-setup/restricted is false.
    - Make sure apt-cdrom doesn't unmount the CD if cd_type ends with

    - Enable all network sources, including security updates, even if the
      network is unconfigured.
    - Honour apt-setup/restricted, apt-setup/universe, and
      apt-setup/multiverse when writing -backports lines.
    - Check to make sure the CD filesystem is iso9660 before remounting it
      as such.  Do not write a CD identifier if we're not working with
      iso9660 so pkgsel does not try to unmount such disks.
    - Run 'apt-get update', without downloading package lists or cleaning up
      old files, after moving the sources.list generated during base system
      installation back into place.
    - If OVERRIDE_LEAVE_CD_MOUNTED is set, don't unmount /cdrom; this is a

  * Merge from Ubuntu:
    - Enable universe and multiverse by default for Ubuntu installs.
    - For Ubuntu installs, if either restricted or multiverse is enabled,
      add commented-out lines for the partner archive.
    - Use archive.ubuntu.com as the default source mirror for Ubuntu ports
      architectures.
    - Add apt-setup/proposed question (never asked); if preseeded to true
      for Ubuntu installs, -proposed entries will be added to sources.list
      (LP: #181776).
  * Adjust cancellation comment in apt-setup-verify: in-target preserves
    exit codes as of debian-installer-utils 1.70.
  * Use fetch-url instead of wget in local generator, making it possible to
    use file:// URLs.

    in the D-I environment during package installation, which means that e.g.
    running anna-install to install udebs is no longer possible. Because of
    this components/scripts also need make sure that the installation CD is
    loaded and mounted again after package installation.
    Components/scripts that can install packages in /target after apt-setup
    has been run should either use apt-install, or create the correct
    conditions themselves (as pkgsel does).
    Requires apt (0.7.9) in testing for #448187 and #448521, and requires
    pkgsel (1.16) and di-utils (1.50).
  * Add myself as uploader.

  * Strip 'deb ' from the start of apt-setup/local*/repository, just in case

  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Install the Ubuntu mirror generator instead of Debian's.
    - Set apt-setup/security_host to security.ubuntu.com, or
      ports.ubuntu.com on ports architectures; adjust directory and
      distribution to match.
    - Add security sources for restricted, universe, and multiverse,
      commented out unless the respective components are enabled. Disable
      security generator checks for contrib and non-free.
    - For CD installs, leave the sources.list created by apt-setup in
      /etc/apt/sources.list.apt-setup, and restore the sources.list created
      during base installation for the rest of the installation.
    - Honour OVERRIDE_BASE_INSTALLABLE when checking
      /cdrom/.disk/base_installable.
    - Enable universe and multiverse by default.
    - If either restricted or multiverse is enabled, add commented-out lines
      for the partner archive.
    - Reduce the mirror verification timeout to 10 seconds.
  * Use archive.ubuntu.com as the default source mirror for ports
    architectures.
  * Disable the volatile service for Ubuntu, and don't ask the
    apt-setup/services-select question.
  * Always disable the CD at the end of installation if any mirrors are
    present, even if it's a complete CD. These days it's more irritating
    than not, and inserting the CD on a desktop system will produce a prompt
    anyway.
  * Default to not using a mirror if the user selected to not configure the
    network in netcfg (copied from Debian mirror generator).
  * Set Vcs-Bzr for Ubuntu.

  * First release as a udeb broken out from base-config and rewritten.

  * This means that apt mirror config uses d-i's mirror configs automatically.
    Closes: #220269, #252121, #235980, #251007
  * Issues with /dev/cdrom symlinks no longer apply, since that's taken
    care of by d-i. Closes: #198759, #264375, #274615
  * Issues with CD eject buttons no longer apply, since well, it currently
    only supports loading in one CD. Closes: #215639, #215639, #240331
    Closes: #333513
    (TODO item exists for multiple CDs tho).
  * Runs in the first stage so no issues with it running again and eating
    configured sources or wanting to clear proxy settings.
    Closes: #229048, #196625
  * Will deal nicely with failure to reach security.debian.org.
    Closes: #251413
  * You can enter a mirror manually in choose-mirror and entry proxy info too.
    Closes: #277481, #284794
  * CD stuff works ok in noninteractive/preseeded modes. Closes: #282356
  * Adds deb-src lines for everything, including security updates.
    Closes: #269154.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Various small fixes.
  * Call the main package apt-setup-udeb to allow for apt-setup.deb in the
    future.
  * Add translation infrastructure.
  * Set epoch to supersede the base-config-based apt-setup-udeb in Ubuntu.
  * Don't bother looking for security updates for unstable.
  * Strip everything after the first dot from generator names when
    constructing progress template names, to allow writing variants of a
    generator with the same basic purpose as the original.
  * Initial untested mirror generator for Ubuntu. Not added to translation
    infrastructure yet, although the templates are there.
