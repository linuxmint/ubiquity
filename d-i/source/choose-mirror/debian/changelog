      to cope with Côte d'Ivoire.
    - Only default mirror/country to the value of debian-installer/country

      to GB.
    - Exclude all-countries mirrors such as ports.ubuntu.com when
      determining whether there is a mirror in the country specified in
      debian-installer/country.
    - If the selected country has no mirror (excluding all-countries

  * Start tracking Mirrors.masterlist instead of only including it when
    building the source package:
    - Sync it as of 2013-10-12.
    - Remove it from .gitignore accordingly.
  * Update debian/rules to run clean then check-masterlist instead of
    clean then Mirrors.masterlist; this new target checks (when the .git
    directory is present and git available) the date of the last update
    to the said file, and warns if it's older than 2 weeks, providing
    instructions to sync the said file, and waiting a few seconds to draw
    attention.
  * Export ONLINE=n when building. Fetching stuff from internet during
    build isn't too nice, especially when failure is allowed.

  * Upgrade to debhelper v7.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Remove no longer needed Lintian override for missing Standards-
    Version field.
  * Drop backwards compatibility support for preseeding of "manual" mirror
    selection.
  * Improve validation of suites available on selected mirror and suite
    selection. Changes include:
    - all suites available on a mirror get validated; if an inconsistency is
      found in any suite (between directory/symlink names and Suite/Codename
      fields in the Release file), the mirror will be rejected as invalid;
    - if a release can be accessed using codename as well as suite, the
      selection dialog will display both;
    - proper support for oldstable; will only be listed in selection dialog if
      it's the requested release (as installer default or through preseeding);
    - improved support for mirror that only have codename directories, such as
      archive.debian.org;
    - support for mirrors that don't have codename directories (but use suite
      names as directories);
    - various code cleanups.
    Many thanks to Jérémy Bobbio for reviewing the changes.

      appropriate choices for Ubuntu.

      as the default mirror.
    - Drop the priorities of the country/mirror questions to medium if we're

      choose-mirror to assume that the base system is installable.
    - Skip mirror validation if the base system is installable and we're
      installing from a mirror in the masterlist.
  * Stop checking if archive.ubuntu.com is reachable before asking for a
    proxy. This caused a number of very long delays on systems behind
    firewalls that dropped packets they didn't like rather than rejecting
    them. Furthermore, now that we have Ubiquity it is less important for
    Ubuntu's d-i to ask as few questions as possible, and more important for
    it to work correctly in corner cases.

  * Don't ask for a proxy if networking is disabled by telling netcfg "Do
    not configure the network at this time" (closes: Malone #29839). This is
    a very ugly way to figure this out, but unfortunately nothing else seems
    to be reliable enough. Ideally, netcfg would write out a piece of
    explicit state somewhere to let us know whether a network is available.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Split input templates files into separate files for http, ftp, and both,
    modify build process so only the relevant templates get included based on
    the protocol support that is built in to the binary. Allows saving
    hundreds of K by disabling ftp support.
  * Queue apt-mirror-setup for installation, this is part of the apt-setup
    replacement that I've not quite gotten around to finishing yet. In the
    meantime, queuing it should be harmless.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Read DISTRIB_CODENAME from /etc/lsb-release if it's present, and use
    that to override the hardcoded PREFERRED_DISTRIBUTION.
  * Remove unnecessary differences between the HTTP and FTP templates.

  [ Sylvain Ferriol ]
  * A mirror can not have an 'etch' dist. choose-mirror is now able to find
    distributions avalaible in the mirror and select the preferred using a
    built-in list.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Move some configurable stuff to the .h file.
  * Formatting and comment fixes.
  * Move proxy env var handing code to its own function.
  * Much code refactoring and cleanup.
  * Combine the steps of checking for a suite that is on the mirror
    and the Release file download and parse, so that the Release file is only
    downloaded once.
  * Display the "bad mirror" message if the manually entered values are
    obviously wrong, rather than the old behavior of silently looping back to
    the start.
  * If a preseeded suite turns out to be bad, go ahead and try to find a
    usable suite on the mirror, rather than the old behavior of accepting the
    bad value and letting things fail later.
  * Make the postinst set mirror/suite based on the lsb_release file
    rather than using a separate environment variable.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Make sure mirror/protocol template is included.
  * After a suite has been selected, also determine its codename. This
    can be used later to set apt sources by codename.
  * Update text for mirror/protocol template after discussion on mailing list.

    - Switch to using iso_3166.xml rather than the deprecated iso_3166.tab,
      by the crude method of copying iso3166tab.py from the iso-codes source
      to convert it to the old .tab format for us on the fly.
    - Build-depend on the first version of iso-codes that shipped
      /usr/share/xml/iso-codes/iso_3166.xml.
    - Allow an alternate location for Mirrors.masterlist to be given on the
      mirrorlist command line, and add Makefile support for this.
    - 'make reallyclean' now depends on 'make clean'.
    - Start counting site ids at 0 in mirrorlist.
    - Support wildcard-DNS-style entries in Mirrors.masterlist, that get
      expanded out to one entry for every country code in iso_3166.xml.
    - Give debian/choose-mirror.templates the same mtime as
      debian/choose-mirror.templates-in, so that po2debconf doesn't decide
      that it needs to run debconf-updatepo on every binary package build.
    - Add the facility to have different default mirrors, directories, etc.
      on different architectures.
    - Set a reasonable (per #debian-amd64) default mirror for amd64.

    - Rename mirror/distribution to the more accurate mirror/suite.
    - Add a PREFERRED_DISTRIBUTION, which is currently sarge.
    - Download and process the Release file from the selected mirror
      for the preferred distribution, and work out which suite it is
      part of, and use that as the defualt for the mirror/suite question.
      This will ensure that, when sarge becomes stable, d-i knows to install
      stable by default rather than sticking with testing.
    - Don't freshen the Mirrors.masterlist if ONLINE=n
    - Remove unnecessary seen flag setting code.
    - Fix backup from manual mirror dir entry.
    - Ask the manual hostname and directory questions in a block, so
      interblock backup can be used, to fix backup from the second question.
    - Fixed the backup support to use cdebconf's new improved backup
      code. Not only is this much simpler, but it fixes many edge cases.
