#  Translators, you should put here the ISO 3166 code of a country
#  which you know hosts at least one Linux Mint FTP mirror. Please check
#  that the country really has an Linux Mint FTP mirror before putting a
#  random value here
#
#  First check that the country you mention here is listed in
#  http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/webwml/trunk/webwml/english/mirror/Mirrors.masterlist
#
#  BE CAREFUL to use the TWO LETTER ISO-3166 CODE and not anything else

#  You do not need to translate what's between the square brackets
#  You should even NOT put square brackets in translations:
#  msgid "GB[ Default value for ftp]"
#  msgstr "FR"

_Description: Linux Mint archive mirror:
 Please select an Linux Mint archive mirror. You should use a mirror in
 your country or region if you do not know which mirror has the best
 Internet connection to you.

 Usually, <your country code>.archive.ubuntu.com is a good choice.
