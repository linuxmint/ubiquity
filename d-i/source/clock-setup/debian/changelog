  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Default to ntp.ubuntu.com for the NTP server.
    - Ask the UTC question, defaulting to true, even if we appear to be the
      only OS (unless clock-setup/utc-auto is preseeded to true).
    - Add lpia to architecture list.
    - Fix rdate-udeb dependency to include the epoch.
    - Fix handling of progress bar cancellation.
  * Apparently OpenSolaris keeps the hardware clock in local time
    (surprisingly). Assume UTC=no if Solaris is detected (LP: #279065).

clock-setup (0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New udeb, loosely derived from base-config and Ubuntu's tzsetup
    udeb.
  * Use OS probing to avoid asking the confusing UTC question most of the
    time. Closes: #240706
  * Don't display system time, that's really a red herring as the point is
    to choose how the time _should_ be stored, not how it is stored.
    Closes: #259869, #270239
    (Yes, this means some users will need to set their hardware clock
    post-install. It might be added to this package, eventually.)
  * Build on all arches except s390, which has none of this hwclock
    nonsense. If other arches always use UTC, I can exclude them too..
