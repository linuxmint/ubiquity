  * Add cn(uig) keyboard (non-latin) variant.
  * Add d-i layouts for all supported languages: al, ara, es(ast), bd, by,
    in(ben), ba, es(cat), cn, bt, epo, et, ge, in(guj), in(jhelum), in(deva),
    ie, in(kan), kz, kh, kr, tr(ku_f), tr(ku), in(mal), np, no(smi), ir,

  * Make console-setup-udeb depend on kbd-udeb or kbdcontrol-udeb to fix

  [ Christian Perrier ]
  * Default to Russian layout with Ossetian variant for Ossetian
    language
  * Galician translation updates. Closes: #644055

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Explicitly build-depend on liblocale-gettext-perl for kbdnames-maker,
    and likewise have keyboard-configuration depend on
    liblocale-gettext-perl.

  [ Anton Zinoviev ]
  * Make U+007C in u_vga16.bdf to be a vertical line instead of broken
    bar.  The fix is in u_vga16_fix.bdf together with the new arabic
    letters from version 1.29.  Thanks to Bjarni Ingi Gislason,
    closes: #646626.
  * keyboard-configuration: depend on initscripts.  Thanks to Johannes
    Schauer, closes: #621077.
  * setupcon: try to use large fonts with consolechars.  Who knows, maybe
    it will be fixed some day...
  * Prefer console-tools to kbd if both utilities are installed.  This is
    wrong as kbd is better but these days only Debian provides
    console-tools and the only way to have both variants of the console
    utilities is when the limited script wrappers of kbd-compat are
    installed.  Thanks to mtths (patch was provided), closes: #631935.
  * setupcon: add /run and /dev to /lib/init/rw as alternative directories
    for temporary files.  Thanks to Michael Biebl, closes: #633153.
  * setupcon: add traps to remove the temporary file when setupcon is
    interrupted.
  * debian/control: use Breaks+Replaces instead of Conflicts
  * ckbcomp-mini: do not drop the lines which do not contain "keycode".
    Thanks to Samuel Thibault.
  * setupcon: assume standard virtual consoles (/dev/tty[1-6], /dev/ttyv[0-3])
    when there is no getty & such to facilitate the detection.  Thanks to
    Samuel Thibault.
  * ckbcomp: never die on errors in the rules files.  This has the
    potential to create some difficult to trace bugs, so issue more
    informative warnings about the problem.  Thanks to Javier Vasquez,
    Jonny, Cédric Boutillier, Daniel Schepler and Peter Eisentraut.
    Closes: #614127, #614550, #625215, #626025, #642287.
  * ckbcomp: interpret dead_abovering as degree sign.  Update the
    xkbsym_date hash in compose_translator.  Thanks to Bjarni Ingi Gislason,

  * Minor additions to keyboard(5) and ckbcomp(1).
  * Add information about setupcon and ckbcomp-mini in the copyright file.
  * Use /lib/init/rw for temporary file if /tmp is mounted read-only.
    When testing whether the keymap has to be recompiled, do not assume
    that either [ file1 -ot file2 ] or [ file2 -ot file1 ] (files can be
    the same age).  Thanks to Jindřich Makovička (he provided a patch),
    Vincent Lefevre, Benoît MERLET and Tony Houghton. 
    Closes: #620228, #620491.

console-setup (1.72) unstable; urgency=low

  * README: /etc/getty=>/etc/gettytab
  * debian/*.init: source /etc/default/locale to permit autodetection of
    the charmap when console-setup-mini operates without configuration
    file.
  * debian/*.init: do not test whether we are on the console, there are
    better tests inside setupcon.
  * setupcon: do not expect the existence of 'tty' (if /usr is not mounted
    'tty' will be unavailable).  Thanks to Sven Joachim, closes: #619462.
  * README.Debian: console-setup-mini no longer installs only a minimal
    set of fonts.  Without configuration file no font will be loaded.
  * A little Lintian cleaning:
    - copyright: add the required reference to common-licenses;
    - restore the separate copyright file for bdf2psf;
    - versioned build dependency on debhelper (>=7.2.3~) for dh_bugfiles;
    - standards version 3.9.1;
    - use dh_lintian to install the override file.
  * setupcon: new options --save-keyboard and --setup-dir.  Keep them
    undocumented for now.
  * setupcon: some bug fixing:
    - the function findfile wouldn't work when setupcon is not run from
      /bin or /usr/local/bin, but from a non-standard location;
    - when working with incomplete information and guessing the font name,
      use [A-WXYZa-wyz] as file pattern for fonts instead of [A-Za-z] (we do
      not want 'x' and in some locales [A-Z] includes 'x').
  * Use all-permissive, non-copyleft license for setupcon and ckbcomp-mini.

console-setup (1.71) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Anton Zinoviev ]
  * FAQ: correct some typos and apply two patches by Jonathan Nieder.
    Thanks also to Vincent Lefevre.  Closes: #565391 (with apologies for
    the delay).
  * New manual pages keyboard(5) and console-setup(5).  Updated ckbcomp(1)
    and setupcon(1). Remove README.fonts.  Common documentation directory
    for keyboard-configuration, console-setup-linux,
    console-setup-freebsd, console-setup and console-setup-mini.  New
    README.Debian.  Thanks to Jorgen Grahn, closes: #617580.
  * Remove most of the comments in the default configuration files.  It is
    difficult to update these comments when the functionality of
    console-setup changes and the new manual pages make these comments
    less necessary.
  * Remove the VERBOSE_OUTPUT option from the default configuration file
    (but it is still supported).
  * Install *.bug-control files for reportbug.
  * Ask the keyboard option question even when Debconf doesn't support the
    layout.  Thanks to Petr Baudis and Julien Cristau, closes: #581758.
  * ckbcomp_mini: process properly empty layout and/or variant options.
    Thanks to Baptiste Carvello who reported the problem and traced its
    source.  Closes: #617499.
  * ckbcomp: ignore actions[...] = ... specifications in key definitions.
    Thanks to Klaus Ethgen, closes: #607532.
  * setupcon: accept all methods to state font size in the configuration
    file (8x14, 14x8, 14).
  * Debconf: More human-friendly options for the font size question.  By
    default use 8x14 format for all sizes.
  * setupcon: Improved test whether we are on the console.  Thanks to
    Michael Schutte and Julien Cristau for the suggestions.
  * console-setup(-mini).postinst: add again commands to configure the
    console.
  * ckbcomp: improved implementation for Alt+PrintScreen=SysRq and
    Ctrl+Pause=Break on AT keyboards.
  * ckbcomp: more correct use of approximate().  This probably affects
    only some exotic key combination such as Ctrl+Alt+Shift+AltGr+F1.
  * ckbcomp: lets try to remove some unnecessary and potentialy harmful on
    non-standard layouts mappings for Linux (Ctrl+'=^G, Ctrl+3=^[,
    Ctrl+4=^\, Ctrl+5=^], Ctrl+7=^_, Ctrl+8=^?).
  * Do not source /etc/default/keyboard in /etc/default/console-setup
    (on new installs or upgrades from pre 1.47 versions).
  * setupcon: do not cache automatically the keymap.  Instead add --save
    option the init script.
  * Do not remove /etc/console-setup in postrm.
  * setupcon, config, postinst: recognise 'guess' value in the
    configuration file.
  * postinst: do not fail if setupcon fails.
  * Include Terminus font in the compiled packages.  Do not depend, but
    conflict and provide console-terminus.  New upstream version of the
    Terminus font (4.32).
  * Keyboard/ckb: update with keyboard data of version 2.1 of xkb files.
    (This change is not relevant for Debian.)
  * New install targets in the Makefiles and debian/rules to better
    support non-Debian installs.
  * Support for FreeBSD.  Packages for Debian GNU/kFreeBSD:
    - bdf2psf: new option --raw to generate raw fonts.  Try to use CP437
      code positions if possible.  When generating raw fonts with same
      codeset, use identical font map.
    - ckbcomp and setupcon: support for FreeBSD keymaps.
    - ckbcomp: new option -backspace [ del | bs ] to determine the
      behaviour of the keys BackSpace and Delete.
    - setupcon, postinst: A corresponding variable BACKSPACE in
      /etc/default/keyboard.
    - Termcap and Terminfo entries for FreeBSD.
    - setupcon: When UTF-8 is requested on FreeBSD, act as if the encoding
      is ISO-8859-1.
    - Debconf: Don't ask the question about font size on kFreeBSD (no need
      for this -- all available sizes will be loaded).
    - New configuration variable VIDEOMODE.  Currently it is most useful
      on FreeBSD because the default Linux framebuffer driver (VesaFB)
      doesn't permit changes of the videomode.
    - Support for 8-bit encodings in console-setup-mini and in the udebs
    - Udebs for kFreeBSD.

    keymaps that need this.  Closes: #514212.  The idea was given by
    Samuel Thibault.  He also provided a patch for proper locale-based
    capitalization of the letters.
  * Do not ignore XF86_Switch_VT_* xkeysyms, closes: #514537.   Patch
    provided by Samuel Thibault.
  * Recognise the braille keys, closes: #514539.  Patch provided by Samuel
    Thibault.

    FONT=...  Thanks to Samuel Thibault, closes: #508862.
  * On first install read defaults for the keyboard layout from
    /etc/X11/xorg.conf.  Julien Cristau provided the script parsing
    xorg.conf. Closes: #515685.
  * Save cached keymap in /etc/console-setup/cached.kmap.gz if possible.
    Thanks to Frédéric Boiteux, closes: #509117.
  * Fix a bug: empty string as keyboard model in the config file when the
    user selects the default keyboard model.
  * Do not display error template when debconf doesn't support the layout in
    the config file.  Ask the user if the settings must be preserved.
    Debconf questions when the default values for layout or options
    (coming most likely from xorg.conf) are not supported.

  * Merge from Linux Mint:
    - Fix property counts in Goha and legacy BDF fonts.
    - Fix keymap reduction not to try to express keymap A in terms of keymap
      B when B includes keys not mapped by A.
    - If reading a user configuration file, disable --save, and don't use
      /etc/console-setup/cached.kmap.gz; using the cached file tends to
      cause confusion here since the maintainer scripts and init scripts are
      expecting that to correspond to the main configuration (LP: #332728).
    - Raise priority to critical for questions preseeded with a nonexistent
      code (LP: #328078).
  * Sort the null variant to the top of the choices list rather than to the
    bottom.
  * Make %.ekmap target depend on MyKeyboardNames.pl.
  * Use printf rather than /bin/echo in setupcon; it's typically a shell
    builtin and is therefore faster.

    keyboard" instead of "What is the layout of your keyboard" and "What
    is the layout of your keyboard" instead of "What is the variant of
    your keyboard".  Ask the console-setup/variant question with critical
    priority.  Thanks to Arnt Karlsen, closes: #352405.
  * Fix the true/yes discrepancy in setupcon which caused the options -k
    and -f not to work.
  * Updated Bulgarian translation.
