console-setup (1.194ubuntu1) focal; urgency=medium

  * Merge from Debian unstable.  Remaining changes:
    - debian/clean: Delete Keyboard/tree-keymaps/ on clean
    - Add an apport hook.
    - If the locale is C during configuration, only set CHARMAP to ISO-8859-15
      on kFreeBSD; otherwise restore the previous behaviour from before the
      kFreeBSD port of using UTF-8 in that case.
    - Change the default font from Fixed to VGA for Lat15; while it's not
      entirely complete, it looks better and is largely good enough.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible and sensible.
    - debian/vtrgb, debian/vtrgb.vga,
      debian/console-setup-linux.setvtrgb.service, debian/rules,
      debian/console-setup-linux.postinst: use Linux Mint's virtual terminal color
      scheme by default, with a VGA color scheme available as an alternative.
    - Handle unattended upgrades without breaking plymouth when updating
      console fonts.
    - Tolerate absence of setupcon in postinst scripts.  Should be fixed by
      refactoring to not have a keyboard-configuration package that needs to
      call setupcon without depending on it.
    - Don't copy keyboard-configuration questions to /target in OEM mode.
      oem-config will ask them later, and copying these confuses it.
    - Added templates for keyboard detection.
    - debian/control: drop freebsd-specific packages.
    - debian/control: we also need xkb-data-i18n as a Build-Depends-Indep to
      build a complete set of translated keyboard layout/variant names.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - keyboard-configuration.config: While sourcing config files to re-seed
      debconf, treat missing XKBOPTIONS as empty.
    - Fix default keyboard selection for language/country combinations
      lacking a proper combined locale.
    - debian/keyboard-configuration.config: lower the priority for the layout
      question.
    - Map ppc64el/* to XKBMODEL=pc105.
    - Set default layout for Kurdish to tr(ku).
    - Set default for Dutch to us(intl), not just us.
    - Set default layout for Vietnam to 'us'.
    - debian/keyboard-configuration.config: Drop the xkb-keymap bits once
      again as we're not ready for those yet, as it's currently causing an
      invalid default layout in the installer.
    - keyboard-configuration.{config,templates}: There is no good default
      for layout toggling, stop pretending there is.  Console users can set
      one with dpkg-reconfigure or editing /etc/defaults/keyboard
    - keyboard_present.sh: Quiet config/postinst when we have no USB devices.
    - debian/preprocessor: revert the removal of keyboard names (for size) of
      console-setup-udeb: we do need those, since we don't use the simplified
      xkb-keymap template from Debian just yet: this way we can still show
      country/language names when selecting a keyboard, layout or variant.
    - debian/rules: revert hard-coding of a list of "debconf-selectable"
      layouts for the udebs, since we don't use this debconf question in Linux Mint
      and all layouts are selectable.
    - Make COPYRIGHT a symlink to debian/copyright.
    - Don't cat over the keymaps; they're already moved to the right place.
    - Add Keyboard/Makefile rule to build pc105.tree.
    - Include pc105.tree for ubiquity; make sure it gets built.
    - Fix command injection in ckbcomp.
    - Generate a locale locally for translating keyboard names in
      kbdnames-maker.
    - Keyboard/Makefile: make sure KeyboardNames.pl is built with accurate data
      from xkb-data.
    - xmlreader, KeyboardNames.pl: Added model entry to skip model selection.
    - Make sure we give a meaningful name to ch layouts: "Switzerland" instead
      of "German (Switzerland), since it includes French too.
    - setupcon:
      - use only /run for tempfiles with /tmp as a non-root fallback.
      - handle compressed console maps and font files.
      - Map XKBMODEL=SKIP to '' for compatibility with existing
        configs.
      - the variables are taken from a config file which, if changed,
        invalidates the cache.
      - there is only ever one keyboard map per system.
      - the system should not have to resolve filenames to find the keymap
        cache on boot.
      - Explicitly exit 0, so that postinsts don't fail in the event that
        loadkeys can't find a console.
  * Dropped changes:
    - kbdnames-maker: Call `{bind,}textdomain` after switching locale.
  * debian/control: Build depend on keymapper

  * kbdnames-maker: Call `{bind,}textdomain` after switching locale.
    There's a change in perl 5.28 to use `uselocale()` & friends instead of
    gettext directly, to support thread safety. Apparently this causes the
    results of `gettext()` calls to be cached now where they weren't before,
    and this breaks our keyboard name generation. For example, we have
    `en_GB*model*sun_type6_jp*Sun Type 6 (Japonesa)` instead of
    `en_GB*model*sun_type6_jp*Sun Type 6 (Japanese)`, and many many other
    examples.  Calling `bindtextdomain()` and then `textdomain()` after
    changing locale causes the cache to be invalidated and we get correct
    results again. LP: #1817453

  * Merge from Debian unstable.  Remaining changes:
    - Add an apport hook.
    - If the locale is C during configuration, only set CHARMAP to ISO-8859-15
      on kFreeBSD; otherwise restore the previous behaviour from before the
      kFreeBSD port of using UTF-8 in that case.
    - Change the default font from Fixed to VGA for Lat15; while it's not
      entirely complete, it looks better and is largely good enough.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible and sensible.
    - debian/vtrgb, debian/vtrgb.vga,
      debian/console-setup-linux.setvtrgb.service, debian/rules,
      debian/console-setup-linux.postinst: use Linux Mint's virtual terminal color
      scheme by default, with a VGA color scheme available as an alternative.
    - Don't copy keyboard-configuration questions to /target in OEM mode.
      oem-config will ask them later, and copying these confuses it.
    - Tolerate absence of setupcon in postinst scripts.
    - Added templates for keyboard detection.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Fix default keyboard selection for language/country combinations
      lacking a proper combined locale.
    - Map ppc64el/* to XKBMODEL=pc105.
    - keyboard_present.sh: Quiet config/postinst when we have no USB devices.
    - debian/preprocessor: revert the removal of keyboard names (for size) of
      console-setup-udeb: we do need those, since we don't use the simplified
      xkb-keymap template from Debian just yet: this way we can still show
      country/language names when selecting a keyboard, layout or variant.
    - Don't make debian/copyright a symlink to COPYRIGHT, this is disallowed
      by the Linux Mint archive installer.
    - Include pc105.tree for ubiquity; make sure it gets built.
    - Add Keyboard/Makefile rule to build pc105.tree.
    - Fix command injection in ckbcomp.
    - Generate a locale locally for translating keyboard names in
      kbdnames-maker.
    - xmlreader, KeyboardNames.pl: Added model entry to skip model selection.
    - setupcon:
      - the variables are taken from a config file which, if changed,
        invalidates the cache.
      - there is only ever one keyboard map per system.
      - the system should not have to resolve filenames to find the keymap cache
        on boot.
      - Map XKBMODEL=SKIP to '' for compatibility with existing
        configs.
      - Explicitly exit 0, so that postinsts don't fail in the event that
        loadkeys can't find a console.
    - Handle unattended upgrades without breaking plymouth when updating
      console fonts.
    - debian/rules: revert hard-coding of a list of "debconf-selectable"
      layouts for the udebs, since we don't use this debconf question in Linux Mint
      and all layouts are selectable.
    - Make sure we give a meaningful name to ch layouts: "Switzerland" instead
      of "German (Switzerland), since it includes French too.
    - Add console-setup-tty and the udev rule that uses it to set Unicode, font,
      and keyboard mode at early boot.
    - Keyboard/Makefile: make sure KeyboardNames.pl is built with accurate data
      from xkb-data.
    - Don't cat over the keymaps; they're already moved to the right place.
    - debian/console-setup.postinst: Replace the checking of fgconsole in [1-6]
      with checking if fgconsole is a tty according to logind. The previous
      assumption was that a graphical environment would be on vt7, which isn't
      true with gnome-shell any more.
    - debian/console-setup.postinst, debian/keyboard-configuration.postinst:
      Don't call setupcon --force -k any more - it breaks wayland sessions.
      (LP: #1710637)
    - debian/control: drop console-setup-freebsd: we don't keep it around since
      it's uninstallable because vidcontrol/kbdcontrol.
    - debian/keyboard-configuration.config: re-lower the priority for the layout
      question that got garbled in the merge.
    - Don't use console-setup-tty or its udev rule. This dates back to lucid and
      now systemd is apparently able to handle this correctly. It's now actively
      breaking graphical sessions. (LP: #1710637) 
    - debian/control: we also need xkb-data-i18n as a Build-Depends-Indep to
      build a complete set of translated keyboard layout/variant names.
    - Drop dependency from console-setup to initramfs-tools |
      linux-initramfs-tool; this was a versioned dependency used for upgrades,
      now long obsolete.
  * Fix previous patches:
    - Correctly setup console in initramfs again (LP: #1719612)
    - Make COPYRIGHT a symlink to debian/copyright, and keep various
      other symlinks in place that were dropped in earlier uploads.
    - Do some extra work to disable kfreebsd, dh was complaining about
      unknown packages and failing.
    - debian/clean: Delete Keyboard/tree-keymaps/ on clean

  * Merge from Debian unstable; remaining changes:
    - Add an apport hook.
    - If the locale is C during configuration, only set CHARMAP to ISO-8859-15
      on kFreeBSD; otherwise restore the previous behaviour from before the
      kFreeBSD port of using UTF-8 in that case.
    - Change the default font from Fixed to VGA for Lat15; while it's not
      entirely complete, it looks better and is largely good enough.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible and sensible.
    - debian/vtrgb, debian/vtrgb.vga,
      debian/console-setup-linux.setvtrgb.service, debian/rules,
      debian/console-setup-linux.postinst: use Linux Mint's virtual terminal color
      scheme by default, with a VGA color scheme available as an alternative.
    - Don't copy keyboard-configuration questions to /target in OEM mode.
      oem-config will ask them later, and copying these confuses it.
    - Tolerate absence of setupcon in postinst scripts.
    - Added templates for keyboard detection.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Fix default keyboard selection for language/country combinations

console-setup (1.142ubuntu1) yakkety; urgency=medium

  * Merge from Debian unstable; remaining changes:
    - Don't gzip font or ACM files in /etc/console-setup/.  The space saving
      is negligible, and it's more efficient not to need to uncompress them
      at boot time.
    - Include pc105.tree for ubiquity.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible and sensible.
    - Add an apport hook.
    - Depend on kbd (>= 1.15-1ubuntu3) for a valuable loadkeys improvement.
    - Include support for translated keyboard names.
    - Depend on debconf instead of pre-depending, because pre-depends have
      no effect on config scripts.
    - debian/vtrgb, debian/vtrgb.vga,
      debian/console-setup-linux.setvtrgb.upstart, debian/rules,
      debian/console-setup-linux.postinst: use Linux Mint's virtual terminal color
      scheme by default, with a VGA color scheme available as an alternative.
    - Make setupcon explicitly exit 0, so that postinsts don't fail in the
      event that loadkeys can't find a console.
    - Generate a locale locally for translating keyboard names in
      kbdnames-maker.
    - Don't copy keyboard-configuration questions to /target in OEM mode.
      oem-config will ask them later, and copying these confuses it.
    - Change the default font from Fixed to VGA for Lat15; while it's not
      entirely complete, it looks better and is largely good enough.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Fix default keyboard selection for language/country combinations
      lacking a proper combined locale.
    - Drop the layout/variant priority to high on fresh installs.
    - Set default for Dutch to us(intl), not just us.
    - Set default layout for Vietnam to 'us'.
    - Set default variant for French to oss.
    - Set default layout for Simplified Chinese to 'cn'.
    - Don't use the default keyboard variant if the layout is overridden by
      preseeding.
    - If keyboard-configuration/layoutcode is preseeded but not marked as
      seen, then set the default layout but don't lower the layout question
      priority or preseed console-setup/ask_detect.
    - Use the default keyboard model if an existing configuration file sets
      XKBMODEL="".
    - Go back to always asking layout before variant.
    - Fix keyboard layout detection to set the layout properly.
    - Reset keyboard-configuration/toggle to the default if it's set to "No
      toggling" and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
      /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init. Similarly,
      ensure that the font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial
      installation.
    - Load the new keyboard configuration immediately when running
      'dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration' in an installed system.
    - Don't fail to configure keyboard-configuration if setxkbmap fails to
      talk to the X display.
    - Tolerate absence of setupcon in keyboard-configuration.postinst.
    - Drop the simplified keyboard-configuration/xkb-keymap question.
    - Fix command injection in ckbcomp.
    - debian/console-setup.console-font.upstart: Add Upstart job that sets up
      console font when plymouth-splash is starting.
    - Override description of the ch layout from "German (Switzerland)" to
      just "Switzerland".
    - Map ppc64el/* to XKBMODEL=pc105.
    - setupcon: Map XKBMODEL=SKIP to '' for compatibility with existing
      configs.
    - debian/rules: revert hard-coding of a list of "debconf-selectable"
      layouts for the udebs, since we don't use this debconf question in Linux Mint
      and all layouts are selectable.
    - setupcon: revert ridiculous upstream twiddling of keymap cache filenames:
      - the variables are taken from a config file which, if changed,
        invalidates the cache.
      - there is only ever one keyboard map per system.
      - the system should not have to resolve filenames to find the keymap cache
        on boot.
    - Move vtrgb handling to console-setup-linux package, since this is clearly
      Linux-specific.
    - Add missing console-setup-linux.prerm to remove /etc/vtrgb alternatives
    - Keyboard/kbdcompiler: fix bug in filtering of unsupported variants that
      breaks generation of the pc105.tree for d-i keyboard detection.
    - debian/keyboard-configuration.postinst: udpkg is not part of an installed
      Debian system; don't fail to configure if it's absent and the script is
      called outside of an installer context.
    - Don't make debian/copyright a symlink to COPYRIGHT, this is disallowed
      by the Linux Mint archive installer.
    - debian/keyboard-configuration.config: fix typo in model check for SKIP;
      even when looking up the layout/variant, we need to check for the model
      as XKBMODEL, since $model doesn't exist.
    - debian/preprocessor: revert the removal of keyboard names (for size) of
      console-setup-udeb: we do need those, since we don't use the simplified
      xkb-keymap template from Debian just yet: this way we can still show
      country/language names when selecting a keyboard, layout or variant.
    - Properly handle settings CODESET and FONSIZE when they equals 'guess' or
      are unset.
    - keyboard_present.sh: Quiet config/postinst when we have no USB devices.
    - debian/keyboard-configuration.config: run grep with -a (to deal with files
      as ASCII data) when searching for keyboard, locale, and layout names.
    - Add ConditionPathExists=/dev/tty0 to the console-setup.service, to
      avoid running the unit on platforms without virtual consoles
    - debian/rules: Drop obsolete and no-op dh_installinit --upstart-only
      option.
    - Add debian/keyboard-configuration.links to (statically) enable
      console-setup.service. It is not being pulled in by plymouth any more, and
      doing so was brittle and unexpected.
    - console-setup.service: Set RemainAfterExit.
    - If the locale is C during configuration, only set CHARMAP to ISO-8859-15
      on kFreeBSD; otherwise restore the previous behaviour from before the
      kFreeBSD port of using UTF-8 in that case.
    - debian/control: allow dracut to be installable by adding an alternate
      depends on linux-initramfs-tool for console-setup.
    - Reinstate checking for XKBLAYOUT being in the config file: this handles
      the cases where installs done with ubiquity don't have their debconf seen
      flag set for model/layout questions. If layout is already configure, lower
      the corresponding question's priority to medium so we don't ask it again.
    - Add systemd unit for console-setup. That avoids waiting for $remote_fs
      during early boot. (Note: there is no need to enable it, it gets pulled
      in through systemd-vconsole-setup.service)
    - Drop console-setup-freebsd; it's useless and uninstallable given that we
      don't have a freebsd port.
    - Make debian/keyboard-configuration.console-setup.init do the same as the
      corresponding .upstart: I. e. just call loadkeys instead of setupcon, and
      don't check the current console. (Font loading is already done via udev
      rules).
  * Dropped changes, included in Debian:
    - Stop running debconf-updatepo on clean.
    - Update for new layouts and variants for Montenegro and Serbia, and
      migrate configuration files from the old layouts.
  * Dropped changes, no longer needed:
    - Move boot tasks to a combination of two udev rules and a single
      Upstart job, ensuring that they're run at points when we are able to
      satisfy the constraints on the relevant ioctls.
    - Replace usplash detection code with Plymouth detection code.
    - Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of
      the pc105 model.
  * debian/console-setup-linux.setvtrgb.service: port our vtrgb upstart job to
    a systemd unit service so we can again apply the right color scheme.
  * Fonts/Makefile: sort BDFS_TO_DOUBLE; this will avoid unnecessary delta
    showing on every upload just because the fonts are not in the same order.

  * Changes in setupcon:
    - new option -t|--terminal-only.  The functionality of the
      old command 'setupcon -f' is now covered by 'setupcon -f -t';
    - new options --current-tty and --print-commands-only;
    - on Linux 'setupcon --save' creates in /etc/console-setup/
      configuration scripts for faster boot configuration;
    - on Linux load the font and the console map using only one
      setfont command;
    - when the keyboard model is unknown, use a default value and
      issue a warning.  Closes: #751955, #788441.  Apply a patch about
      KMAP by Michal Maruska;
    - more robust test whether /etc is writable, closes: #810246;
    - setup-dir: configure only the keyboard and only the current
      console.  Create a flag file /run/console-setup/keymap_loaded so
      that we can avoid loading the keyboard second time.
  * Changes in ckbcomp:
    - remove the 'use locale' pragma as suggested by Klaus Ethgen.
      Closes: #810538.
  * kbdcompiler: create a log file ckbcomp.log.
  * On Linux: use precomputed scripts and Udev to configure the console.
    Closes: #759657, #763695.
  * On Linux: move init.d/console-setup.sh out of single user mode.
    Closes: #796603, #816090.
  * Move the init scripts from keyboard-configuration to
    console-setup-linux and console-setup-freebsd.  Closes: #805928.
    Give them a .sh extension to make them sourcable.  Move the
    dependency on initscripts to these two packages.  Closes: #804988.
  * postinst: run update-rc.d with parameter 'defaults'. Closes: #722064.
  * Put db_stop near the end of console-setup.postinst.  Redirect all
    output of setupcon to /dev/null.  Hopefully, this
    closes: #782753, #776101.
  * debian/keyboard_present.sh: add a pattern for Bluetooth keyboards,
    closes: #807945.
  * keyboard-configuration.config: the Serbian keyboard layout is 'rs',
    not 'cs'.  For Bulgarian consider bg,bg as unsupported by Debconf.  Do
    not set default variant 'bds' for Bulgarian or 'latin' for Serbian but
    use default values instead.  Closes: #778721, #778722.
  * Remove Keyboard/locale/lib/ from the source package.  Closes: #787528
  * bug-control: add systemd to the packages in the package-status list.
  * Make the builds reproducible.  Thanks to Reiner Herrmann for the
    patch.  Closes: #775531.
  * Minor clarifications in man/keyboard.5
  * Make console-setup-linux and console-setup-freebsd conflict with each
    other so that lintian is pleased.

    - Make debian/keyboard-configuration.console-setup.init do the same as the
      corresponding .upstart: I. e. just call loadkeys instead of setupcon, and
      don't check the current console. (Font loading is already done via udev

console-setup (1.108ubuntu1) vivid; urgency=medium

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * Merge from Debian unstable, remaining changes: (LP: #1426721)
    - Don't gzip font or ACM files in /etc/console-setup/.  The space saving
      is negligible, and it's more efficient not to need to uncompress them
      at boot time.
    - Include pc105.tree for ubiquity.
    - Move boot tasks to a combination of two udev rules and a single
      Upstart job, ensuring that they're run at points when we are able to
      satisfy the constraints on the relevant ioctls.
    - Stop running debconf-updatepo on clean.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible and sensible.
    - Add an apport hook.
    - Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of
      the pc105 model.
    - Depend on kbd (>= 1.15-1ubuntu3) for a valuable loadkeys improvement.
    - Include support for translated keyboard names.
    - Depend on debconf instead of pre-depending, because pre-depends have
      no effect on config scripts.
    - debian/vtrgb, debian/vtrgb.vga,
      debian/console-setup-linux.setvtrgb.upstart, debian/rules,
      debian/console-setup-linux.postinst: use Linux Mint's virtual terminal color
      scheme by default, with a VGA color scheme available as an alternative.
    - Make setupcon explicitly exit 0, so that postinsts don't fail in the
      event that loadkeys can't find a console.
    - Update for new layouts and variants for Montenegro and Serbia, and
      migrate configuration files from the old layouts.
    - Generate a locale locally for translating keyboard names in
      kbdnames-maker.
    - Don't copy keyboard-configuration questions to /target in OEM mode.
      oem-config will ask them later, and copying these confuses it.
    - Change the default font from Fixed to VGA for Lat15; while it's not
      entirely complete, it looks better and is largely good enough.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Fix default keyboard selection for language/country combinations
      lacking a proper combined locale.
    - Drop the layout/variant priority to high on fresh installs.
    - Set default for Dutch to us(intl), not just us.
    - Set default layout for Vietnam to 'us'.
    - Set default variant for French to oss.
    - Set default layout for Simplified Chinese to 'cn'.
    - Don't use the default keyboard variant if the layout is overridden by
      preseeding.
    - If keyboard-configuration/layoutcode is preseeded but not marked as
      seen, then set the default layout but don't lower the layout question
      priority or preseed console-setup/ask_detect.
    - Use the default keyboard model if an existing configuration file sets
      XKBMODEL="".
    - Go back to always asking layout before variant.
    - Fix keyboard layout detection to set the layout properly.
    - Reset keyboard-configuration/toggle to the default if it's set to "No
      toggling" and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
      /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init. Similarly,
      ensure that the font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial
      installation.
    - Replace usplash detection code with Plymouth detection code.
    - Load the new keyboard configuration immediately when running
      'dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration' in an installed system.
    - Don't fail to configure keyboard-configuration if setxkbmap fails to
      talk to the X display.
    - Tolerate absence of setupcon in keyboard-configuration.postinst.
    - Drop the simplified keyboard-configuration/xkb-keymap question.
    - Fix command injection in ckbcomp.
    - debian/console-setup.console-font.upstart: Add Upstart job that sets up
      console font when plymouth-splash is starting.
    - Override description of the ch layout from "German (Switzerland)" to
      just "Switzerland".
    - Map ppc64el/* to XKBMODEL=pc105.
  * Dropped changes, included in Debian:
    - "Do not configure keyboard; keep kernel keymap" model option,
      preseedable by keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP: this is now
      supported upstream with either "unknown" or an empty string as the
      model.
    - Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
      tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out
      of raw mode is a very bad idea.
    - Include Terminus font in the compiled packages.  Do not depend, but
      conflict/provide/replace console-terminus.  New upstream version of
      the Terminus font (4.32).
    - Explicitly build-depend on liblocale-gettext-perl for kbdnames-maker,
      and likewise have keyboard-configuration depend on
      liblocale-gettext-perl.
    - Make keyboard-configuration replace old console-setup/console-setup-mini
      versions as well as conflicting with them.
    - Weaken test for whether /usr is mounted; testing for /usr/share is
      sufficient, and fixes operation in d-i.
    - Set default layout for Kurdish to tr(ku).
  * Dropped changes, no longer needed:
    - Cope with systems installed with console-setup-udeb (<< 1.53) (which
      predates Linux Mint 12.04 and Debian wheezy).
    - Drop ancient handling of an empty codeset in the config file.
    - Drop vtrgb upgrade handling from natty
    - Drop upstart job transition from lucid
  * setupcon: Map XKBMODEL=SKIP to '' for compatibility with existing
    configs.
  * debian/rules: revert hard-coding of a list of "debconf-selectable"
    layouts for the udebs, since we don't use this debconf question in Linux Mint
    and all layouts are selectable.
  * setupcon: revert ridiculous upstream twiddling of keymap cache filenames:
    - the variables are taken from a config file which, if changed,
      invalidates the cache.
    - there is only ever one keyboard map per system.
    - the system should not have to resolve filenames to find the keymap cache
      on boot.
  * Move vtrgb handling to console-setup-linux package, since this is clearly
    Linux-specific.
  * Add missing console-setup-linux.prerm to remove /etc/vtrgb alternatives
  * Keyboard/kbdcompiler: fix bug in filtering of unsupported variants that
    breaks generation of the pc105.tree for d-i keyboard detection.
  * debian/keyboard-configuration.postinst: udpkg is not part of an installed
    Debian system; don't fail to configure if it's absent and the script is
    called outside of an installer context.
  * Don't make debian/copyright a symlink to COPYRIGHT, this is disallowed
    by the Linux Mint archive installer.

  [ Mathieu Trudel-Lapierre ]
  * debian/keyboard-configuration.config: fix typo in model check for SKIP;
    even when looking up the layout/variant, we need to check for the model
    as XKBMODEL, since $model doesn't exist.
  * debian/preprocessor: revert the removal of keyboard names (for size) of
    console-setup-udeb: we do need those, since we don't use the simplified
    xkb-keymap template from Debian just yet: this way we can still show
    country/language names when selecting a keyboard, layout or variant.

  * Prefer console-tools to kbd if both utilities are installed.  This is
    wrong as kbd is better but these days only Debian provides

  * README: /etc/getty=>/etc/gettytab
  * debian/*.init: source /etc/default/locale to permit autodetection of
    the charmap when console-setup-mini operates without configuration

  * debian/*.init: do not test whether we are on the console, there are
    better tests inside setupcon.
  * setupcon: do not expect the existence of 'tty' (if /usr is not mounted
    'tty' will be unavailable).  Thanks to Sven Joachim, closes: #619462.
  * README.Debian: console-setup-mini no longer installs only a minimal
    set of fonts.  Without configuration file no font will be loaded.
  * A little Lintian cleaning:
    - copyright: add the required reference to common-licenses;
    - restore the separate copyright file for bdf2psf;
    - versioned build dependency on debhelper (>=7.2.3~) for dh_bugfiles;
    - standards version 3.9.1;
    - use dh_lintian to install the override file.
  * setupcon: new options --save-keyboard and --setup-dir.  Keep them
    undocumented for now.
  * setupcon: some bug fixing:
    - the function findfile wouldn't work when setupcon is not run from
      /bin or /usr/local/bin, but from a non-standard location;
    - when working with incomplete information and guessing the font name,
      use [A-WXYZa-wyz] as file pattern for fonts instead of [A-Za-z] (we do
      not want 'x' and in some locales [A-Z] includes 'x').
  * Use all-permissive, non-copyleft license for setupcon and ckbcomp-mini.

  * FAQ: correct some typos and apply two patches by Jonathan Nieder.
    Thanks also to Vincent Lefevre.  Closes: #565391 (with apologies for
    the delay).
  * New manual pages keyboard(5) and console-setup(5).  Updated ckbcomp(1)
    and setupcon(1). Remove README.fonts.  Common documentation directory

    console-setup-freebsd, console-setup and console-setup-mini.  New
    README.Debian.  Thanks to Jorgen Grahn, closes: #617580.
  * Remove most of the comments in the default configuration files.  It is
    difficult to update these comments when the functionality of
    console-setup changes and the new manual pages make these comments
    less necessary.
  * Remove the VERBOSE_OUTPUT option from the default configuration file
    (but it is still supported).
  * Install *.bug-control files for reportbug.
  * Ask the keyboard option question even when Debconf doesn't support the
    layout.  Thanks to Petr Baudis and Julien Cristau, closes: #581758.
  * ckbcomp_mini: process properly empty layout and/or variant options.
    Thanks to Baptiste Carvello who reported the problem and traced its
    source.  Closes: #617499.
  * ckbcomp: ignore actions[...] = ... specifications in key definitions.
    Thanks to Klaus Ethgen, closes: #607532.
  * setupcon: accept all methods to state font size in the configuration
    file (8x14, 14x8, 14).
  * Debconf: More human-friendly options for the font size question.  By
    default use 8x14 format for all sizes.
  * setupcon: Improved test whether we are on the console.  Thanks to
    Michael Schutte and Julien Cristau for the suggestions.
  * console-setup(-mini).postinst: add again commands to configure the
    console.
  * ckbcomp: improved implementation for Alt+PrintScreen=SysRq and
    Ctrl+Pause=Break on AT keyboards.
  * ckbcomp: more correct use of approximate().  This probably affects
    only some exotic key combination such as Ctrl+Alt+Shift+AltGr+F1.
  * ckbcomp: lets try to remove some unnecessary and potentialy harmful on
    non-standard layouts mappings for Linux (Ctrl+'=^G, Ctrl+3=^[,
    Ctrl+4=^\, Ctrl+5=^], Ctrl+7=^_, Ctrl+8=^?).
  * Do not source /etc/default/keyboard in /etc/default/console-setup
    (on new installs or upgrades from pre 1.47 versions).
  * setupcon: do not cache automatically the keymap.  Instead add --save
    option the init script.
  * Do not remove /etc/console-setup in postrm.
  * setupcon, config, postinst: recognise 'guess' value in the
    configuration file.
  * postinst: do not fail if setupcon fails.
  * Include Terminus font in the compiled packages.  Do not depend, but
    conflict and provide console-terminus.  New upstream version of the
    Terminus font (4.32).
  * Keyboard/ckb: update with keyboard data of version 2.1 of xkb files.
    (This change is not relevant for Debian.)
  * New install targets in the Makefiles and debian/rules to better
    support non-Debian installs.
  * Support for FreeBSD.  Packages for Debian GNU/kFreeBSD:
    - bdf2psf: new option --raw to generate raw fonts.  Try to use CP437
      code positions if possible.  When generating raw fonts with same
      codeset, use identical font map.
    - ckbcomp and setupcon: support for FreeBSD keymaps.
    - ckbcomp: new option -backspace [ del | bs ] to determine the
      behaviour of the keys BackSpace and Delete.
    - setupcon, postinst: A corresponding variable BACKSPACE in
      /etc/default/keyboard.
    - Termcap and Terminfo entries for FreeBSD.
    - setupcon: When UTF-8 is requested on FreeBSD, act as if the encoding
      is ISO-8859-1.
    - Debconf: Don't ask the question about font size on kFreeBSD (no need
      for this -- all available sizes will be loaded).
    - New configuration variable VIDEOMODE.  Currently it is most useful
      on FreeBSD because the default Linux framebuffer driver (VesaFB)
      doesn't permit changes of the videomode.
    - Support for 8-bit encodings in console-setup-mini and in the udebs
    - Udebs for kFreeBSD.

console-setup (1.70ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * Merge from Debian testing, remaining changes:
    - Include Terminus font in the compiled packages.  Do not depend, but
      conflict/provide/replace console-terminus.  New upstream version of
      the Terminus font (4.32).
    - Add a "Do not configure keyboard; keep kernel keymap" model option,
      preseedable by keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP.
    - Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of
      the pc105 model.
    - Update for new layouts and variants for Montenegro and Serbia, and
      migrate configuration files from the old layouts.
    - Generate a locale locally for translating keyboard names in
      kbdnames-maker.
    - Move boot tasks to a combination of two udev rules and a single
      Upstart job, ensuring that they're run at points when we are able to
      satisfy the constraints on the relevant ioctls.
    - Don't gzip font or ACM files in /etc/console-setup/.  The space saving
      is negligible, and it's more efficient not to need to uncompress them
      at boot time.
    - Don't copy keyboard-configuration questions to /target in OEM mode.
      oem-config will ask them later, and copying these confuses it.
    - Add an apport hook.
    - Change the default font from Fixed to VGA for Lat15; while it's not
      entirely complete, it looks better and is largely good enough.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible and sensible.
    - Don't try to call update-rc.d if it doesn't exist, such as in d-i.
    - debian/vtrgb, debian/vtrgb.vga, debian/console-setup.setvtrgb.upstart,
      debian/rules, debian/console-setup.postinst: use Linux Mint's virtual
      terminal color scheme by default, with a VGA color scheme available
      as an alternative.
    - Explicitly build-depend on liblocale-gettext-perl for kbdnames-maker,
      and likewise have keyboard-configuration depend on
      liblocale-gettext-perl.
    - Depend on debconf instead of pre-depending, because pre-depends have
      no effect on config scripts.
    - Make keyboard-configuration replace old console-setup/console-setup-mini
      versions as well as conflicting with them.
    - Depend on kbd (>= 1.15-1ubuntu3) for a valuable loadkeys improvement.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Fix default keyboard selection for language/country combinations
      lacking a proper combined locale.
    - Drop the layout/variant priority to high on fresh installs.
    - Set default for Dutch to us(intl), not just us.
    - Set default layout for Kurdish to tr(ku).
    - Set default layout for Vietnam to 'us'.
    - Set default variant for French to oss.
    - Set default layout for Simplified Chinese to 'cn'.
    - Don't use the default keyboard variant if the layout is overridden by
      preseeding.
    - If keyboard-configuration/layoutcode is preseeded but not marked as
      seen, then set the default layout but don't lower the layout question
      priority or preseed console-setup/ask_detect.
    - Use the default keyboard model if an existing configuration file sets
      XKBMODEL="".
    - console-setup-udeb (<< 1.53) didn't set the seen flag in the installed
      system.  Cope with this and avoid asking the layout and variant
      questions again if the default debconf priority is at least high.
      (squeeze has >> 1.53, so this can be dropped after 12.04.)
    - Go back to always asking layout before variant.
    - Fix keyboard layout detection to set the layout properly.
    - Reset keyboard-configuration/toggle to the default if it's set to "No
      toggling" and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
      /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init. Similarly,
      ensure that the font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial
      installation.
    - Replace usplash detection code with Plymouth detection code.
    - Load the new keyboard configuration immediately when running
      'dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration' in an installed system.
    - Don't fail to configure keyboard-configuration if setxkbmap fails to
      talk to the X display.
    - Tolerate absence of setupcon in keyboard-configuration.postinst.
    - Move keyboard detection templates from console-setup.templates to
      keyboard-configuration.templates.
    - Stop running debconf-updatepo on clean.
    - Include pc105.tree for ubiquity.
    - Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
      tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out
      of raw mode is a very bad idea.
    - Weaken test for whether /usr is mounted; testing for /usr/share is
      sufficient, and fixes operation in d-i.
    - Make setupcon explicitly exit 0, so that postinsts don't fail in the
      event that loadkeys can't find a console.
  * Dropped changes:
    - Special KPDL handling: rewritten upstream in version 1.24.
    - Upgrade handling for broken 1.57ubuntu1-1.57ubuntu4: prerelease
      versions from natty, code dropped.
    - Allow underscores in rules variables: included upstream.
  * Restore plugin-detect-keyboard handling code, accidentally dropped in
    a previous merge; keyboard detecting code was probably broken in the gtk
    frontend by this.

  * Resynchronise with Debian.  Remaining changes:
    - Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of
      the pc105 model.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Reset keyboard-configuration/toggle to the default if it's set to "No
      toggling" and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Change the default font from Fixed to VGA for Lat15; while it's not
      entirely complete, it looks better and is largely good enough.
    - Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
      /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init. Similarly,
      ensure that the font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial
      installation.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible and sensible.
    - Set default variant for French to oss.
    - Set default for Dutch to us(intl), not just us.
    - Set default layout for Vietnam to 'us'.
    - Set default layout for Kurdish to tr(ku).
    - Stop running debconf-updatepo on clean.
    - Update for new layouts and variants for Montenegro and Serbia, and
      migrate configuration files from the old layouts.
    - Add a "Do not configure keyboard; keep kernel keymap" model option,
      preseedable by keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP.
    - Drop the layout/variant priority to high on fresh installs.
    - Honour OVERRIDE_ALLOW_PRESEEDING environment variable when deciding
      whether to allow preseeding, which is ordinarily only allowed in d-i.
    - If keyboard-configuration/layoutcode is preseeded but not marked as
      seen, then set the default layout but don't lower the layout question
      priority or preseed console-setup/ask_detect.
    - Add an apport hook.
    - Generate a locale locally for translating keyboard names in
      kbdnames-maker.
    - Replace usplash detection code with Plymouth detection code.
    - Move boot tasks to a combination of two udev rules and a single
      Upstart job, ensuring that they're run at points when we are able to
      satisfy the constraints on the relevant ioctls.
    - Depend on kbd (>= 1.15-1ubuntu3) for a valuable loadkeys improvement.
    - Don't try to call update-rc.d if it doesn't exist, such as in d-i.
    - Don't gzip font or ACM files in /etc/console-setup/.  The space saving
      is negligible, and it's more efficient not to need to uncompress them
      at boot time.
    - Remove iconv transliteration.  We don't use non-UTF-8 locales, and it
      breaks ubiquity as we haven't generated the configured locale by the
      time we hit console-setup.
  * Go back to always asking layout before variant.
  * Migrate from old console-setup/* to new keyboard-configuration/*
    question names.
  * Use the default keyboard model if an existing configuration file sets
    XKBMODEL="".
  * Exit cleanly from initramfs hook if /etc/default/keyboard or
    /etc/default/console-setup don't exist for some reason (LP: #634402).
  * Fix description of upstart job to not incorrectly claim that it sets the
    font (LP: #632366).

  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of
      the pc105 model.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Reset console-setup/toggle to the default if it's set to "No toggling"
      and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Change the default font from Fixed to VGA for Lat15; while it's not
      entirely complete, it looks better and is largely good enough.
    - Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
      tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out
      of raw mode is a very bad idea.
    - Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
      /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init. Similarly,
      ensure that the font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial
      installation.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible.
    - Set default variant for French to oss.

  * Better Arabic letters for VGA16 fonts.  Thanks to Ahmed El-Mahmoudy,

  * I was suggested to use VGA font face instead of Terminus by
    default. Unfortunately in most cases VGA is incomplete so in these
    cases I used Fixed.  I don't think Fixed is better choice than
    Terminus so feel free to revert the defaults back to Terminus, they

    - Fix property counts in Goha and legacy BDF fonts.
    - Fix keymap reduction not to try to express keymap A in terms of keymap
      B when B includes keys not mapped by A.
    - If reading a user configuration file, disable --save, and don't use
      /etc/console-setup/cached.kmap.gz; using the cached file tends to
      cause confusion here since the maintainer scripts and init scripts are
      expecting that to correspond to the main configuration (LP: #332728).
    - Raise priority to critical for questions preseeded with a nonexistent

    - Disable workaround in ckbcomp for the kernel not applying Caps Lock to

console-setup (1.21ubuntu1) hardy; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of
      the pc105 model.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Reset console-setup/toggle to the default if it's set to "No toggling"
      and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Change the default font from Terminus to VGA where supported.
    - Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
      tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out
      of raw mode is a very bad idea.
    - Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
      /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init. Similarly,
      ensure that the font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial
      installation.
    - Disable workaround in ckbcomp for the kernel not applying Caps Lock to
      non-ASCII letters, except for Turkish layouts; the cure is worse than
      the disease because it makes Caps Lock equivalent to Shift Lock.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible.
    - Set default variant for French to oss.
    - Fix handling of commas in layout and variant names.
    - Fix keymap reduction not to try to express keymap A in terms of keymap
      B when B includes keys not mapped by A.
    - debian/config.proto: Set sparc default model to pc105.
    - Remove 'exit 0' from the end of debian/config.proto; this will be
      sourced from the postinst in the installer, and exiting in the
      successful case means that /etc/default/console-setup never gets
      generated.
    - Switch back to console-tools-udeb for now.
    - Stop running debconf-updatepo on clean.
  * Update for new layouts and variants for Japan, Montenegro, and Serbia,
    and migrate configuration files from the old layouts.

  * Set default model to pc105 on powerpc/ps3 and powerpc/cell systems.
  * Clean up the package description a little.
  * Only default to Canadian layout for fr_CA; use U.S. English for other
    *_CA locales (LP: #64418).
  * Improve ckbcomp(1) formatting.
  * Run setupcon with --save in the postinst to ensure that required data is

  * Load the saved keymap in /etc/console-setup/boottime.kmap.gz if

  [ Debconf templates translations ]
  * Belarusian. Closes: #447109
  * Galician. Closes: #447940

  [ Christian Perrier ]
  * Correct "Provides:" in console-setup init script to allow insserv
    to insert console-setup properly in the boot sequence.
    Thanks to Petter Reinholdtsen for the patch. Closes: #458486
  * Add the required "Default-Stop" and "Required-Stop" fields in the
    init.d/console-setup script.
  * Set myself as Uploader.
  * Fixing lintian warnings:
    - Remove "perl, libxml-parser-perl" from Build-Depends. They were
      duplicated in Build-Depends-Indep
    - Do not ignore non-zero exit status of "make maintainer-clean" in the
      clean target
    - Turn console-setup/dont_ask_layout into an error template. That'll
      get rid of the lintian warning and this is more accurate anyway.
  * Fixing lintian errors:
    - No longer install an example file in
      /usr/share/doc/console-setup-mini/examples/console-setup
      for the udeb package

  * Add the required "Default-Stop" and "Required-Stop" fields in the
    init.d/keyboard-setup script.

      borrowed from kbd-chooser.
    I disabled the code for making UTF-8 default charmap in d-i because
    there are locales which use other charmap.  However I made setupcon to

    Watson:
    - Do not sorce the debconf library in the middle of the postinst,
      closes: #420831.
    - Remove from the source package several directories
      debian/UDEB-PACKAGE-NAME.  (The udebs were removed from
      debian/control before running the clean target.)  Closes: #420912.
    - Map fr_CH locale to Swiss French default keyboard
      layout in config.proto.  Closes: #420828.
    - Pass xkbdir variable on the make-command line, because else its
      value is overriden and the keymap definitions in Keyboard/ckb are
      used.  Closes: #420827.
    - A new option --save-only for setupcon.
    - Ship KeyboardNames.pl and kbdnames-maker.  Closes: #420914.
    - Fix Esperanto locale check in config.proto, closes: #420785.  Make
      'epo' the default layout for Esperanto.
    - The Bosnian layout is 'ba', not 'bs'.  Closes: #420787.
    - The layout variant is 'deva', not 'dev'.  Closes: #420797.
    - Do not leave empty default codeset for unsupported locales.
      Closes: #420802.
    - Use 'jp(latin)' instead of 'us' in the Latin mode of Japanese
      keyboards.  Override the keyboard model if it was chosen by default
      and the layout is Japanese or Brasilian.  Closes: #420824.
    - Add --save-only option to setupcon.  Closes: #420832.
    - Multiply the Installer-Menu-Item field of the udebs by 100.
      Closes: #421260.
    - By default do not use AltGr with basic US keyboard.  Closes: #421263.
    - Make sure amiga, ataritt, sun4 and sun5 are in KeyboardNames.pl even
      if they are not in the xml database.  Closes: #420821.
    - Talk about 'national' instead of 'non-Latin' mode in the templates.
      Treat the Lithuanian keyboard as a two-mode keyboard similarly to
      the Serbian keyboard.  Closes: #421261.
  * Do not ignore the Control+ and Alt+non_symbol_key combinations.
    Thanks to Karsten Hilbert, closes: #421796.
  * Two additions to the FAQ:
    - Add a suggestion for the VBERestore option.  Thanks to Dmitry
      Semyonov, closes: #402143.
    - Document CapsLock working as ShiftLock in Unicode mode.
  * Added manual page for setupcon.  Thanks to Vassilis Pandis,

  * Add a --save-only option to setupcon, to save the keyboard/font on the

  * Back out part of setup-console-under-usplash changes: attempts to change
    the font must be guarded against being run while on an X display or
    while usplash is running, because some kernel console drivers (at least
    vgacon) are fundamentally unable to change the font only on some virtual
    consoles, and will corrupt video memory if you try (LP: #73955). We now
    use setupcon --save-only to make sure the font is available on the root
    filesystem for the next boot but don't load it immediately.

console-setup (1.13ubuntu1) feisty; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of
      the pc105 model.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Ship KeyboardNames.pl and kbdnames-maker in /usr/share/console-setup.
    - Only default to Canadian layout for fr_CA; use U.S. English for other
      *_CA locales.
    - Fix default layout for Bosnian and default variant for Hindi.
    - Set default charmap for d-i to UTF-8.
    - Remove unhelpful defaults for several questions.
    - Adjust the default keyboard model for Brazilian and Japanese layouts.
    - Allow preseeding of console-setup/modelcode, console-setup/layoutcode,
      console-setup/variantcode, console-setup/optionscode, and
      console-setup/fontsize.
    - Use jp(latin),jp rather than us,jp by default for Japanese.
    - Reset console-setup/toggle to the default if it's set to "No toggling"
      and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Change the default font from Terminus to VGA where supported.
    - Skip now-unnecessary console check in init scripts.
    - Fix up font face and size on upgrading from old versions in Edgy.
    - Add a few bits of installer integration to console-setup-udeb borrowed
      from kbd-chooser.
    - console-setup Depends: perl; something in ckbcomp is causing perl to
      'use utf8' implicitly, and some of the necessary modules aren't in
      perl-base.
    - Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
      tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out
      of raw mode is a very bad idea.
  * Restore udeb generation.

  * Map fr_CH to ch(fr) (Swiss French).
  * Include ch(fr) in keymap tree.
  * Fix codeset question priority for Esperanto.
  * Remove X and usplash checks in keyboard-setup and console-setup init
    scripts, since neither are needed following the fix in console-setup
    1.7ubuntu19.
  * Allow setupcon to be run on install again, for the same reason.
  * Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
    /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init; this allows
    us to tolerate XKB data being moved to /usr. Similarly, ensure that the
    font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial installation.

console-setup (1.7ubuntu19) edgy; urgency=low

  * If upgrading from an older version than this one, check for the Terminus
    font face and change it to VGA (if you do like it, you can change it
    back and it won't be touched again). If Terminus was in use, also check
    for the 12x6 font size and change it to 16, since that was apparently
    selected due to a strange use-of-debconf bug.
  * Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
    tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out of
    raw mode is a very bad idea (closes: Malone #66929; requires kbd 1.12-15

  * Update debian-installer/keymap handling from trunk (Anton Zinoviev).
    Drop /etc/X11/xorg.conf upgrade handling, also per trunk, as I've been
    convinced that that is much less safe due to the prevalence of GNOME/KDE
    keymap overrides, and furthermore it made it more difficult to have
    ubiquity tell console-setup just to guess a default from the locale.
  * Drop the priority of the model and layout questions to medium if a
    configuration file already exists, since they'll have been asked at
    medium first time round and if we then ask them at critical the second
    time round they will be unexpectedly shown (closes: Malone #59883).

    keyboard" instead of "What is the layout of your keyboard" and "What
    is the layout of your keyboard" instead of "What is the variant of
    your keyboard".  Ask the console-setup/variant question with critical
    priority.  Thanks to Arnt Karlsen, closes: #352405.
  * Fix the true/yes discrepancy in setupcon which caused the options -k
    and -f not to work.
  * Updated Bulgarian translation.
