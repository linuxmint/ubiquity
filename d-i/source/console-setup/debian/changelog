  * Remove iconv transliteration.  We don't use non-UTF-8 locales, and
    it breaks ubiquity as we haven't generated the configured locale by

  * console-setup-tty: Only call setfont once, for both font and ACM.
  * Don't try to call update-rc.d if it doesn't exist, such as in d-i
    (LP: #540835).
  * Don't gzip font or ACM files in /etc/console-setup/.  The space saving
    is negligible, and it's more efficient not to need to uncompress them at

  * Move boot tasks to a combination of two udev rules and a single Upstart
    job, ensuring that they're run at points when we are able to satisfy the
    constraints on the relevant ioctls.  This may not work optimally with
    vgacon, but you have to go to special effort to use that with Ubuntu
    now, and it at least shouldn't break (LP: #524439).
  * Set default layout for Guernsey, Jersey, and the Isle of Man to gb
    (LP: #533003).
  * Fix incorrect FONT and ACM tests in initramfs script.
  * Depend on kbd (>= 1.15-1ubuntu3) for a valuable loadkeys improvement.
    This was previously a recommends, but the udev rule won't work without
    kbd or console-tools anyway, I'm not really interested in supporting a
    system without either installed, and console-tools is thoroughly
    obsolete now.

console-setup (1.34ubuntu1) karmic; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of
      the pc105 model.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Reset console-setup/toggle to the default if it's set to "No toggling"
      and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Change the default font from Fixed to VGA for Lat15; while it's not
      entirely complete, it looks better and is largely good enough.
    - Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
      tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out
      of raw mode is a very bad idea.
    - Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
      /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init. Similarly,
      ensure that the font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial
      installation.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible.
    - Set default variant for French to oss.
    - Set default for Dutch to us(intl), not just us.
    - Set default layout for Vietnam to 'us'.
    - Set default layout for Kurdish to tr(ku).
    - Fix handling of commas in layout and variant names.
    - debian/config.proto: Set sparc default model to pc105.
    - Remove 'exit 0' from the end of debian/config.proto; this will be
      sourced from the postinst in the installer, and exiting in the
      successful case means that /etc/default/console-setup never gets
      generated.
    - Stop running debconf-updatepo on clean.
    - Update for new layouts and variants for Japan, Montenegro, and Serbia,
      and migrate configuration files from the old layouts.
    - Add a "Do not configure keyboard; keep kernel keymap" model option,
      preseedable by console-setup/modelcode=SKIP.
    - Drop the layout/variant priority to high on fresh installs.
    - Honour OVERRIDE_ALLOW_PRESEEDING environment variable when deciding
      whether to allow preseeding, which is ordinarily only allowed in d-i.
    - If console-setup/layoutcode is preseeded but not marked as seen, then
      set the default layout but don't lower the layout question priority or
      preseed console-setup/ask_detect.
    - Treat the Kazakhstan layout (kz) as non-Latin.

    - If reading a user configuration file, disable --save, and don't use

console-setup (1.24ubuntu1) intrepid; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of
      the pc105 model.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Reset console-setup/toggle to the default if it's set to "No toggling"
      and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Change the default font from Terminus to VGA where supported.
    - Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
      tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out
      of raw mode is a very bad idea.
    - Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
      /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init. Similarly,
      ensure that the font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial
      installation.
    - Disable workaround in ckbcomp for the kernel not applying Caps Lock to
      non-ASCII letters, except for Turkish layouts; the cure is worse than
      the disease because it makes Caps Lock equivalent to Shift Lock.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible.
    - Set default variant for French to oss.
    - Set default for Dutch to us(intl), not just us.
    - Set default layout for Vietnam to 'us'.
    - Set default layout for Kurdish to tr(ku).
    - Fix handling of commas in layout and variant names.
    - Fix keymap reduction not to try to express keymap A in terms of keymap
      B when B includes keys not mapped by A.
    - debian/config.proto: Set sparc default model to pc105.
    - Remove 'exit 0' from the end of debian/config.proto; this will be
      sourced from the postinst in the installer, and exiting in the
      successful case means that /etc/default/console-setup never gets
      generated.
    - Switch back to console-tools-udeb for now.
    - Stop running debconf-updatepo on clean.
    - Update for new layouts and variants for Japan, Montenegro, and Serbia,
      and migrate configuration files from the old layouts.
    - Add a "Do not configure keyboard; keep kernel keymap" model option,
      preseedable by console-setup/modelcode=SKIP.
    - Drop the layout/variant priority to high on fresh installs.
    - Honour OVERRIDE_ALLOW_PRESEEDING environment variable when deciding
      whether to allow preseeding, which is ordinarily only allowed in d-i.

    Urgency medium because #484822 is related to the default settings used
    by d-i for some languages.
  * Improved support for non 'KP_...' keys in the keypad block.
  * console-setup-mini and udebs: fix some bugs in modifiers in
    precompiled non-latin layouts
  * Support for some new X key symbols (some of them spelling errors).
  * ckbcomp: accept a list after virtual_modifiers
  * Debconf support for grp:alt_caps_toggle, grp:lctrl_lshift_toggle,

    support them on the console.
  * update Keyboard/ckb with the keyboard data of xkb-data version 1.3-1

console-setup (1.15ubuntu1) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian (LP: #94177). Remaining changes:
    - Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of
      the pc105 model.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Ship MyKeyboardNames.pl (as KeyboardNames.pl) and kbdnames-maker in
      /usr/share/console-setup.
    - Only default to Canadian layout for fr_CA; use U.S. English for other
      *_CA locales.
    - Fix default layout for Bosnian and default variant for Hindi.
    - Set default charmap for d-i to UTF-8.
    - Remove unhelpful defaults for several questions.
    - Adjust the default keyboard model for Brazilian and Japanese layouts.
    - Allow preseeding of console-setup/modelcode, console-setup/layoutcode,
      console-setup/variantcode, console-setup/optionscode, and
      console-setup/fontsize.
    - Use jp(latin),jp rather than us,jp by default for Japanese.
    - Reset console-setup/toggle to the default if it's set to "No toggling"
      and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Change the default font from Terminus to VGA where supported.
    - Add a few bits of installer integration to console-setup-udeb borrowed
      from kbd-chooser.
    - console-setup Depends: perl; something in ckbcomp is causing perl to
      'use utf8' implicitly, and some of the necessary modules aren't in
      perl-base.
    - Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
      tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out
      of raw mode is a very bad idea.
    - Map fr_CH to ch(fr) (Swiss French).
    - Fix codeset question priority for Esperanto.
    - Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
      /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init. Similarly,
      ensure that the font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial
      installation.
    - Disable workaround in ckbcomp for the kernel not applying Caps Lock to
      non-ASCII letters, except for Turkish layouts; the cure is worse than
      the disease because it makes Caps Lock equivalent to Shift Lock.
    - Add a --save-only option to setupcon, to save the keyboard/font on the
      root filesystem but not actually tell the kernel to set it up. Use it
      to make sure the font is available on the root filesystem for the next
      boot but not to load it immediately, avoiding console manipulation
      when X or usplash is running.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible.
    - Add lt to list of non-Latin keymaps.
    - Set default variant for French to oss.
    - Fix handling of commas in layout and variant names.
    - Fix keymap reduction not to try to express keymap A in terms of keymap
      B when B includes keys not mapped by A.
    - Source debconf confmodule earlier in postinst.
    - Fix horrible confusion if the locale has no supported default codeset.
    - Fix console-setup/codeset default to be one of the available choices.
    - Don't set an AltGr key by default for US layouts.
    - Add amiga, ataritt, sun4, and sun5 models, since they are used as
      defaults on certain architectures.
    - Map keycode 133 to AT scancode 124 for Japanese.
  * debian/config.proto: Set sparc default model to pc105 (LP: #105595).
  * debian/control: Multiply Installer-Menu-Item number by 100.
  * debian/control: Remove outdated note about loadkeys in
    console-setup-udeb's description.
  * debian/console-setup.postinst: Drop font fixups for upgrades from
    development versions of Edgy.

    the font must be guarded against being run while on an X display or
    while usplash is running, because some kernel console drivers (at least
    vgacon) are fundamentally unable to change the font only on some virtual
    consoles, and will corrupt video memory if you try (LP: #73955). We now
    use setupcon --save-only to make sure the font is available on the root

    Drop /etc/X11/xorg.conf upgrade handling, also per trunk, as I've been

  * If there's no console-setup configuration when console-setup.config
    runs, then:
    - If there is an xorg.conf, set the defaults from there.
    - Failing that, if debian-installer/keymap is set, try to guess correct
      defaults from that using the same algorithm as formerly applied by
      xserver-xorg.config. The only serious change I made to the algorithm
      is that it now maps (mac-usb-)uk to plain gb, not gb(intl), since
      that's closer to what UK keyboard users generally expect.

console-setup (1.7ubuntu5) edgy; urgency=low

  * Only call setupcon from postinst script if /lib/debian-installer exists,
    to make sure we're really in d-i. (Calling setupcon from X appears to
    make things rather messy.)

console-setup (1.7ubuntu4) edgy; urgency=low

  * Remove cs from the list of non-Latin layouts, as it has special
    per-variant handling.
  * Fix syntax error in config script.
  * Don't try to use the detect-keyboard plugin if running noninteractively.

console-setup (1.7ubuntu3) edgy; urgency=low

  * Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of the
    pc105 model. (I tried building trees for the whole model, but this took
    far too long.)
  * If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
    (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
    detect the keyboard layout.
  * Fix debian/po/POTFILES.in to point to console-setup.templates.
  * Make console-setup-udeb depend on console-setup-fonts-udeb, at least for
    now.
  * Convert init script to LSB logging functions.
  * Add a few bits of installer integration to console-setup-udeb borrowed
    from kbd-chooser (/lib/debian-installer.d/S55console-setup,
    post-base-installer hook).
  * Temporarily build-depend and depend on just xkeyboard-config to work
    around Malone #59220.
  * Set default charmap for d-i to UTF-8.
  * Remove unhelpful "none" defaults for several questions.

console-setup (1.7ubuntu2) edgy; urgency=low

  * Make console-setup-udeb depend on console-tools-udeb.

console-setup (1.7ubuntu1) edgy; urgency=low

  * Call setupcon with input and output from /dev/tty in postinst and make
    sure setupcon understands that properly.

  * Added Czech translation. Closes: #360333

  [ Anton Zinoviev ]
  * Keyboard/ckbcomp: include /usr/share/X11/xkb to the list of
    directories for keyboard data.  The data from /etc/console-setup/ckb
    are still the default.

    0.8-5.  Update ckbcomp with two new keysyms (Cyrillic_(CHE|KA)_vertbar).
  * Do not package the keyboard data.  Depend on xkb-data.  Thanks to
    Denis Barbier, closes: #359775.
  * Fix a shell syntax error in debian/config.proto that causes
    installation of console-setup to hang on powerpc.  Thanks to Colin
    Watson, closes: #374765.
  * ckbcomp: new option -compact to generate compact keymaps.
  * New experimental package console-setup-mini and udebs for d-i.
  * Correct a typo in the Bulgarian translation.  Thanks to Yavor Doganov,

console-setup (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Anton Zinoviev ]
  * Few comments in debian/templates.
  * Document in console-setup/fontsize-fb template that non 8-pixel wide
    fonts can not be used with console-tools.  Add a warning in setupcon
    if the user tries to use such fonts with console-tools.  Thanks to
    Hans Ulrich Niedermann, closes: #352911.
  * debian/postinst: protect in double quotes the variables read from
    $CONFIGFILE.  Thanks to Jonas Meurer, closes: #353525.
  * ckbcomp: Do not interpret xkeysyms such as F10, F11 and F12 as
    hexadecimal numbers.  Thanks to Bálint Balogh, closes: #354564.
  * Debconf: if there are unrecognised options, do not override the value
    of XKBOPTIONS in /etc/default/console-setup.  Thanks to Javier Kohen,
    closes: #354473.
  * Updated Bulgarian translation.
  
  [ Christian Perrier ]

console-setup (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * In the Debconf question for the font size add an information that some
    of the font sizes are non available in text mode and with radeonfb.
    Thanks to Hans Ulrich Niedermann, closes: #352911.

 -- Anton Zinoviev <zinoviev@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Feb 2006 12:22:04 +0200

console-setup (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make debconf templates a bit less verbose.  Make them compliant with
    writing style recommended in the developers references.  Thanks to
    Christian Perrier for the patch, closes: #352772.

 -- Anton Zinoviev <zinoviev@debian.org>  Tue, 14 Feb 2006 20:52:24 +0200

console-setup (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make the Debconf config script not override the user's answers with
    default values when executed at postinst time.  Thanks to Juhapekka
    Tolvanen, closes: #352299.

 -- Anton Zinoviev <zinoviev@debian.org>  Mon, 13 Feb 2006 21:41:20 +0200

console-setup (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix some bugs related to non-UTF8 modes:
    - setupcon always sets up the first console in UTF-8 mode
    - setupcon doesn't load ACM in the first console if kbd is used 
    - ckbcomp has to interpret the "acute" Xkeysym as apostrophe.
    Thanks to Norbert Preining, closes: #352449.

 -- Anton Zinoviev <zinoviev@debian.org>  Mon, 13 Feb 2006 21:37:42 +0200

console-setup (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Run setupcon in postinst.  Thanks to Recai Oktaş for the suggestion.
  * Setupcon uses /proc/self/fd/2 (standard error) instead of
    /proc/self/fd/0 (standard output) in order to determine whether we are
    on the console or not.  That way setupcon can detect that we are on
    the console even when it is invoked from postinst and Debconf has
    changed standard input and output.
  * Changes in the text of some questions: "What is the origin of our
    keyboard" instead of "What is the layout of your keyboard" and "What
    is the layout of your keyboard" instead of "What is the variant of
    your keyboard".  Ask the console-setup/variant question with critical
    priority.  Thanks to Arnt Karlsen, closes: #352405.
  * Fix the true/yes discrepancy in setupcon which caused the options -k
    and -f not to work.
  * Updated Bulgarian translation.
