console-setup (1.70ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * Merge from Debian testing, remaining changes:
    - Include Terminus font in the compiled packages.  Do not depend, but
      conflict/provide/replace console-terminus.  New upstream version of
      the Terminus font (4.32).
    - Add a "Do not configure keyboard; keep kernel keymap" model option,
      preseedable by keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP.
    - Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of
      the pc105 model.
    - Update for new layouts and variants for Montenegro and Serbia, and
      migrate configuration files from the old layouts.
    - Generate a locale locally for translating keyboard names in
      kbdnames-maker.
    - Move boot tasks to a combination of two udev rules and a single
      Upstart job, ensuring that they're run at points when we are able to
      satisfy the constraints on the relevant ioctls.
    - Don't gzip font or ACM files in /etc/console-setup/.  The space saving
      is negligible, and it's more efficient not to need to uncompress them
      at boot time.
    - Don't copy keyboard-configuration questions to /target in OEM mode.
      oem-config will ask them later, and copying these confuses it.
    - Add an apport hook.
    - Change the default font from Fixed to VGA for Lat15; while it's not
      entirely complete, it looks better and is largely good enough.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible and sensible.
    - Don't try to call update-rc.d if it doesn't exist, such as in d-i.
    - debian/vtrgb, debian/vtrgb.vga, debian/console-setup.setvtrgb.upstart,
      debian/rules, debian/console-setup.postinst: use Ubuntu's virtual
      terminal color scheme by default, with a VGA color scheme available
      as an alternative.
    - Explicitly build-depend on liblocale-gettext-perl for kbdnames-maker,
      and likewise have keyboard-configuration depend on
      liblocale-gettext-perl.
    - Depend on debconf instead of pre-depending, because pre-depends have
      no effect on config scripts.
    - Make keyboard-configuration replace old console-setup/console-setup-mini
      versions as well as conflicting with them.
    - Depend on kbd (>= 1.15-1ubuntu3) for a valuable loadkeys improvement.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Fix default keyboard selection for language/country combinations
      lacking a proper combined locale.
    - Drop the layout/variant priority to high on fresh installs.
    - Set default for Dutch to us(intl), not just us.
    - Set default layout for Kurdish to tr(ku).
    - Set default layout for Vietnam to 'us'.
    - Set default variant for French to oss.
    - Set default layout for Simplified Chinese to 'cn'.
    - Don't use the default keyboard variant if the layout is overridden by
      preseeding.
    - If keyboard-configuration/layoutcode is preseeded but not marked as
      seen, then set the default layout but don't lower the layout question
      priority or preseed console-setup/ask_detect.
    - Use the default keyboard model if an existing configuration file sets
      XKBMODEL="".
    - console-setup-udeb (<< 1.53) didn't set the seen flag in the installed
      system.  Cope with this and avoid asking the layout and variant
      questions again if the default debconf priority is at least high.
      (squeeze has >> 1.53, so this can be dropped after 12.04.)
    - Go back to always asking layout before variant.
    - Fix keyboard layout detection to set the layout properly.
    - Reset keyboard-configuration/toggle to the default if it's set to "No
      toggling" and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
      /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init. Similarly,
      ensure that the font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial
      installation.
    - Replace usplash detection code with Plymouth detection code.
    - Load the new keyboard configuration immediately when running
      'dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration' in an installed system.
    - Don't fail to configure keyboard-configuration if setxkbmap fails to
      talk to the X display.
    - Tolerate absence of setupcon in keyboard-configuration.postinst.
    - Move keyboard detection templates from console-setup.templates to
      keyboard-configuration.templates.
    - Stop running debconf-updatepo on clean.
    - Include pc105.tree for ubiquity.
    - Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
      tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out
      of raw mode is a very bad idea.
    - Weaken test for whether /usr is mounted; testing for /usr/share is
      sufficient, and fixes operation in d-i.
    - Make setupcon explicitly exit 0, so that postinsts don't fail in the
      event that loadkeys can't find a console.
  * Dropped changes:
    - Special KPDL handling: rewritten upstream in version 1.24.
    - Upgrade handling for broken 1.57ubuntu1-1.57ubuntu4: prerelease
      versions from natty, code dropped.
    - Allow underscores in rules variables: included upstream.
  * Restore plugin-detect-keyboard handling code, accidentally dropped in
    a previous merge; keyboard detecting code was probably broken in the gtk
    frontend by this.

  * Drop misguided Ubuntu-specific code to migrate from console-setup/* to
    keyboard-configuration/* question names.  This is already handled on
    upgrade by reading the old /etc/default/console-setup file
    (LP: #698263).
  * console-setup-udeb (<< 1.53) didn't set the seen flag in the installed
    system.  Cope with this and avoid asking the layout and variant
    questions again if the default debconf priority is at least high
    (LP: #705883).
  * If we detect the above breakage (upgrading from anything between
    1.57ubuntu1 and 1.57ubuntu4 inclusive, and the XKB* values in
    /etc/default/keyboard differ from the commented-out values in
    /etc/default/console-setup), reset to the commented-out values in
    /etc/default/console-setup.

console-setup (1.57ubuntu3) natty; urgency=low

  * Correct fix for LP: #634402: explicitly check readability of
    /etc/default/keyboard and /etc/default/console-setup in initramfs hooks,
    rather than trying to guard '.' with '||' which doesn't work
    (LP: #701954).

console-setup (1.57ubuntu1) natty; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian.  Remaining changes:
    - Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of
      the pc105 model.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Reset keyboard-configuration/toggle to the default if it's set to "No
      toggling" and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Change the default font from Fixed to VGA for Lat15; while it's not
      entirely complete, it looks better and is largely good enough.
    - Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
      /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init. Similarly,
      ensure that the font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial
      installation.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible and sensible.
    - Set default variant for French to oss.
    - Set default for Dutch to us(intl), not just us.
    - Set default layout for Vietnam to 'us'.
    - Set default layout for Kurdish to tr(ku).
    - Stop running debconf-updatepo on clean.
    - Update for new layouts and variants for Montenegro and Serbia, and
      migrate configuration files from the old layouts.
    - Add a "Do not configure keyboard; keep kernel keymap" model option,
      preseedable by keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP.
    - Drop the layout/variant priority to high on fresh installs.
    - Honour OVERRIDE_ALLOW_PRESEEDING environment variable when deciding
      whether to allow preseeding, which is ordinarily only allowed in d-i.
    - If keyboard-configuration/layoutcode is preseeded but not marked as
      seen, then set the default layout but don't lower the layout question
      priority or preseed console-setup/ask_detect.
    - Add an apport hook.
    - Generate a locale locally for translating keyboard names in
      kbdnames-maker.
    - Replace usplash detection code with Plymouth detection code.
    - Move boot tasks to a combination of two udev rules and a single
      Upstart job, ensuring that they're run at points when we are able to
      satisfy the constraints on the relevant ioctls.
    - Depend on kbd (>= 1.15-1ubuntu3) for a valuable loadkeys improvement.
    - Don't try to call update-rc.d if it doesn't exist, such as in d-i.
    - Don't gzip font or ACM files in /etc/console-setup/.  The space saving
      is negligible, and it's more efficient not to need to uncompress them
      at boot time.
    - Remove iconv transliteration.  We don't use non-UTF-8 locales, and it
      breaks ubiquity as we haven't generated the configured locale by the
      time we hit console-setup.
  * Go back to always asking layout before variant.
  * Migrate from old console-setup/* to new keyboard-configuration/*
    question names.
  * Use the default keyboard model if an existing configuration file sets
    XKBMODEL="".
  * Exit cleanly from initramfs hook if /etc/default/keyboard or
    /etc/default/console-setup don't exist for some reason (LP: #634402).
  * Fix description of upstart job to not incorrectly claim that it sets the
    font (LP: #632366).

  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of
      the pc105 model.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Reset console-setup/toggle to the default if it's set to "No toggling"
      and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Change the default font from Fixed to VGA for Lat15; while it's not
      entirely complete, it looks better and is largely good enough.
    - Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
      tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out
      of raw mode is a very bad idea.
    - Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
      /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init. Similarly,
      ensure that the font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial
      installation.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible.
    - Set default variant for French to oss.
    - Set default for Dutch to us(intl), not just us.
    - Set default layout for Vietnam to 'us'.
    - Set default layout for Kurdish to tr(ku).
    - Fix handling of commas in layout and variant names.
    - debian/config.proto: Set sparc default model to pc105.
    - Remove 'exit 0' from the end of debian/config.proto; this will be
      sourced from the postinst in the installer, and exiting in the
      successful case means that /etc/default/console-setup never gets
      generated.
    - Stop running debconf-updatepo on clean.
    - Update for new layouts and variants for Japan, Montenegro, and Serbia,
      and migrate configuration files from the old layouts.
    - Add a "Do not configure keyboard; keep kernel keymap" model option,
      preseedable by console-setup/modelcode=SKIP.
    - Drop the layout/variant priority to high on fresh installs.
    - Honour OVERRIDE_ALLOW_PRESEEDING environment variable when deciding
      whether to allow preseeding, which is ordinarily only allowed in d-i.
    - If console-setup/layoutcode is preseeded but not marked as seen, then
      set the default layout but don't lower the layout question priority or
      preseed console-setup/ask_detect.
    - Treat the Kazakhstan layout (kz) as non-Latin.

    - Change the default font from Terminus to VGA where supported.
    - Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current

      of raw mode is a very bad idea.
    - Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in

      installation.
    - Disable workaround in ckbcomp for the kernel not applying Caps Lock to
      non-ASCII letters, except for Turkish layouts; the cure is worse than
      the disease because it makes Caps Lock equivalent to Shift Lock.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible.

  * Remove 'exit 0' from the end of debian/config.proto; this will be

console-setup (1.16ubuntu1) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of
      the pc105 model.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Only default to Canadian layout for fr_CA; use U.S. English for other
      *_CA locales.
    - Set default charmap for d-i to UTF-8.
    - Remove unhelpful defaults for several questions.
    - Allow preseeding of console-setup/modelcode, console-setup/layoutcode,
      console-setup/variantcode, console-setup/optionscode, and
      console-setup/fontsize.
    - Reset console-setup/toggle to the default if it's set to "No toggling"
      and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Change the default font from Terminus to VGA where supported.
    - Add a few bits of installer integration to console-setup-udeb borrowed
      from kbd-chooser.
    - console-setup Depends: perl; something in ckbcomp is causing perl to
      'use utf8' implicitly, and some of the necessary modules aren't in
      perl-base.
    - Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
      tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out
      of raw mode is a very bad idea.
    - Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
      /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init. Similarly,
      ensure that the font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial
      installation.
    - Disable workaround in ckbcomp for the kernel not applying Caps Lock to
      non-ASCII letters, except for Turkish layouts; the cure is worse than
      the disease because it makes Caps Lock equivalent to Shift Lock.
    - Use 'setupcon --save-only' to make sure the font is available on the
      root filesystem for the next boot but not to load it immediately,
      avoiding console manipulation when X or usplash is running.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible.
    - Set default variant for French to oss.
    - Fix handling of commas in layout and variant names.
    - Fix keymap reduction not to try to express keymap A in terms of keymap
      B when B includes keys not mapped by A.
    - debian/config.proto: Set sparc default model to pc105.
    - debian/control: Remove outdated note about loadkeys in
      console-setup-udeb's description.
  * Allow kbd's initramfs hook as an alternative to that provided by
    console-tools.
  * Don't run 'setupcon -k' from rcS if usplash is running, as that means
    the console will be in raw mode and loadkeys will do confusing things to
    the keymap (LP: #84156).

console-setup (1.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update ckbconf with the most recent list of xkeysyms.
  * Thanks to Colin Watson and Ubuntu team for the many bugs and
    improvements fixed in this release.  Patches were provided by Colin
    Watson:
    - Do not sorce the debconf library in the middle of the postinst,
      closes: #420831.
    - Remove from the source package several directories
      debian/UDEB-PACKAGE-NAME.  (The udebs were removed from
      debian/control before running the clean target.)  Closes: #420912.
    - Map fr_CH locale to Swiss French default keyboard
      layout in config.proto.  Closes: #420828.
    - Pass xkbdir variable on the make-command line, because else its
      value is overriden and the keymap definitions in Keyboard/ckb are
      used.  Closes: #420827.
    - A new option --save-only for setupcon.
    - Ship KeyboardNames.pl and kbdnames-maker.  Closes: #420914.
    - Fix Esperanto locale check in config.proto, closes: #420785.  Make
      'epo' the default layout for Esperanto.
    - The Bosnian layout is 'ba', not 'bs'.  Closes: #420787.
    - The layout variant is 'deva', not 'dev'.  Closes: #420797.
    - Do not leave empty default codeset for unsupported locales.
      Closes: #420802.  
    - Use 'jp(latin)' instead of 'us' in the Latin mode of Japanese
      keyboards.  Override the keyboard model if it was chosen by default
      and the layout is Japanese or Brasilian.  Closes: #420824.
    - Add --save-only option to setupcon.  Closes: #420832.
    - Multiply the Installer-Menu-Item field of the udebs by 100.
      Closes: #421260.
    - By default do not use AltGr with basic US keyboard.  Closes: #421263.
    - Make sure amiga, ataritt, sun4 and sun5 are in KeyboardNames.pl even
      if they are not in the xml database.  Closes: #420821.
    - Talk about 'national' instead of 'non-Latin' mode in the templates.
      Treat the Lithuanian keyboard as a two-mode keyboard similarly to
      the Serbian keyboard.  Closes: #421261.
  * Do not ignore the Control+ and Alt+non_symbol_key combinations.
    Thanks to Karsten Hilbert, closes: #421796.
  * Two additions to the FAQ:
    - Add a suggestion for the VBERestore option.  Thanks to Dmitry
      Semyonov, closes: #402143.
    - Document CapsLock working as ShiftLock in Unicode mode.
  * Added manual page for setupcon.  Thanks to Vassilis Pandis,
    closes: #405005. 
  * Added Dutch translation.  Thanks to Bart Cornelis, closes: #415518.
  * Updated Bulgarian translation.

      non-ASCII letters, except for Turkish layouts; the cure is worse than
      the disease because it makes Caps Lock equivalent to Shift Lock.
    - Add a --save-only option to setupcon, to save the keyboard/font on the

      to make sure the font is available on the root filesystem for the next
      boot but not to load it immediately, avoiding console manipulation

    - Fix console-setup/codeset default to be one of the available choices.
    - Don't set an AltGr key by default for US layouts.
    - Add amiga, ataritt, sun4, and sun5 models, since they are used as
      defaults on certain architectures.
    - Map keycode 133 to AT scancode 124 for Japanese.
  * debian/config.proto: Set sparc default model to pc105 (LP: #105595).

  * debian/control: Remove outdated note about loadkeys in
    console-setup-udeb's description.
  * debian/console-setup.postinst: Drop font fixups for upgrades from
    development versions of Edgy.

  * Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible. Setting these as early

  * Add a --save-only option to setupcon, to save the keyboard/font on the

  * Back out part of setup-console-under-usplash changes: attempts to change
    the font must be guarded against being run while on an X display or
    while usplash is running, because some kernel console drivers (at least
    vgacon) are fundamentally unable to change the font only on some virtual
    consoles, and will corrupt video memory if you try (LP: #73955). We now
    use setupcon --save-only to make sure the font is available on the root
    filesystem for the next boot but don't load it immediately.

      console-setup/variantcode, console-setup/optionscode, and
      console-setup/fontsize.
    - Use jp(latin),jp rather than us,jp by default for Japanese.
    - Reset console-setup/toggle to the default if it's set to "No toggling"
      and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Change the default font from Terminus to VGA where supported.
    - Skip now-unnecessary console check in init scripts.
    - Fix up font face and size on upgrading from old versions in Edgy.
    - Add a few bits of installer integration to console-setup-udeb borrowed

    - console-setup Depends: perl; something in ckbcomp is causing perl to

    - Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
      tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out
      of raw mode is a very bad idea.
  * Restore udeb generation.

  * Map fr_CH to ch(fr) (Swiss French).
  * Include ch(fr) in keymap tree.
  * Fix codeset question priority for Esperanto.
  * Remove X and usplash checks in keyboard-setup and console-setup init
    scripts, since neither are needed following the fix in console-setup
    1.7ubuntu19.
  * Allow setupcon to be run on install again, for the same reason.
  * Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
    /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init; this allows
    us to tolerate XKB data being moved to /usr. Similarly, ensure that the
    font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial installation.

console-setup (1.7ubuntu19) edgy; urgency=low

  * If upgrading from an older version than this one, check for the Terminus
    font face and change it to VGA (if you do like it, you can change it
    back and it won't be touched again). If Terminus was in use, also check
    for the 12x6 font size and change it to 16, since that was apparently
    selected due to a strange use-of-debconf bug.
  * Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
    tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out of
    raw mode is a very bad idea (closes: Malone #66929; requires kbd 1.12-15
    or console-tools 1:0.2.3dbs-62ubuntu10).

console-setup (1.7ubuntu18) edgy; urgency=low

  * Change the default font to VGA where supported; Terminus does not seem
    to have widespread aesthetic appeal.
  * Use jp(latin),jp rather than us,jp by default for Japanese, and set the
    model to jp106 (closes: Malone #63915).
  * Build-depend on keymapper (>= 0.5.3-7) for improved Alt-handling logic.

console-setup (1.7ubuntu17) edgy; urgency=low

  * Only default to Canadian layout for fr_CA; use U.S. English for other
    *_CA locales (closes: Malone #64418).
  * Install kbdnames-maker in /usr/share/console-setup, to make it easier
    for non-Perl programs to use KeyboardNames.pl.

    - New mini-font georgian16.bdf to be used for the Georgian letters in
      Fixed16, author: Gia Shervashidze.  Thanks to Vladimer Sichinava.

  * Remove obsolete XORGCONFIGFILE variable.
  * Reset console-setup/toggle to the default if it's set to "No toggling"
    and you select a non-Latin layout (closes: Malone #63178).

console-setup (1.7ubuntu12) edgy; urgency=low

  * Don't run the init script (and thereby setupcon) on upgrade; just print
    a message telling you to run setupcon from a virtual console if you want
    to update your console configuration (closes: Malone #61723).
  * Update debian-installer/keymap handling from trunk (Anton Zinoviev).
    Drop /etc/X11/xorg.conf upgrade handling, also per trunk, as I've been
    convinced that that is much less safe due to the prevalence of GNOME/KDE
    keymap overrides, and furthermore it made it more difficult to have
    ubiquity tell console-setup just to guess a default from the locale.
  * Drop the priority of the model and layout questions to medium if a
    configuration file already exists, since they'll have been asked at
    medium first time round and if we then ask them at critical the second
    time round they will be unexpectedly shown (closes: Malone #59883).
  * Backport from trunk:
    - config.proto: Handle properly the case when the user backs up from the
      first Debconf question.

console-setup (1.7ubuntu10) edgy; urgency=low

  * console-setup Depends: perl; something in ckbcomp is causing perl to
    'use utf8' implicitly, and some of the necessary modules aren't in
    perl-base (closes: Malone #60203).
  * Allow preseeding of console-setup/modelcode, console-setup/layoutcode,
    console-setup/variantcode, console-setup/optionscode, and
    console-setup/fontsize.
  * Don't set up the console font at boot time if usplash is running, since
    that seems to trigger a kernel bug that corrupts the usplash display
    (closes: Malone #60483).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 21 Sep 2006 01:01:54 +0100

console-setup (1.7ubuntu9) edgy; urgency=low

  * Switch build-dependency and dependency back to xkb-data, now that it's
    fixed. Make the dependencies versioned until after Edgy is released to
    avoid problems with partially-upgraded systems where only the broken
    xkb-data is installed.

console-setup (1.7ubuntu8) edgy; urgency=low

  * Add setupcon --force option and use it in postinst (Anton Zinoviev,
    http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-kbd-devel/2006-August/000278.html).
  * Check $DISPLAY rather than /proc/self/fd/2 in /etc/init.d/keyboard-setup
    and /etc/init.d/console-setup; use setupcon --force.

console-setup (1.7ubuntu7) edgy; urgency=low

  * Handle debian-installer/locale not being available (closes: Malone
    #59718).
  * Remove stray Keyboard/amiga.ekmap in source package.
  * Fix a potential infinite loop in the config script while moving past the
    variant question with an unsupported layout.

console-setup (1.7ubuntu6) edgy; urgency=low

  * If there's no console-setup configuration when console-setup.config
    runs, then:
    - If there is an xorg.conf, set the defaults from there.
    - Failing that, if debian-installer/keymap is set, try to guess correct
      defaults from that using the same algorithm as formerly applied by
      xserver-xorg.config. The only serious change I made to the algorithm
      is that it now maps (mac-usb-)uk to plain gb, not gb(intl), since
      that's closer to what UK keyboard users generally expect.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri,  8 Sep 2006 00:13:26 +0100

console-setup (1.7ubuntu5) edgy; urgency=low

  * Only call setupcon from postinst script if /lib/debian-installer exists,
    to make sure we're really in d-i. (Calling setupcon from X appears to
    make things rather messy.)

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  7 Sep 2006 17:11:12 +0100

console-setup (1.7ubuntu4) edgy; urgency=low

  * Remove cs from the list of non-Latin layouts, as it has special
    per-variant handling.
  * Fix syntax error in config script.
  * Don't try to use the detect-keyboard plugin if running noninteractively.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  7 Sep 2006 15:39:38 +0100

console-setup (1.7ubuntu3) edgy; urgency=low

  * Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of the
    pc105 model. (I tried building trees for the whole model, but this took
    far too long.)
  * If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
    (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
    detect the keyboard layout.
  * Fix debian/po/POTFILES.in to point to console-setup.templates.
  * Make console-setup-udeb depend on console-setup-fonts-udeb, at least for
    now.
  * Convert init script to LSB logging functions.
  * Add a few bits of installer integration to console-setup-udeb borrowed
    from kbd-chooser (/lib/debian-installer.d/S55console-setup,
    post-base-installer hook).
  * Temporarily build-depend and depend on just xkeyboard-config to work
    around Malone #59220.
  * Set default charmap for d-i to UTF-8.
  * Remove unhelpful "none" defaults for several questions.

  * Call setupcon with input and output from /dev/tty in postinst and make
    sure setupcon understands that properly.

  * Added Czech translation. Closes: #360333

  [ Anton Zinoviev ]

    0.8-5.  Update ckbcomp with two new keysyms (Cyrillic_(CHE|KA)_vertbar).
  * Do not package the keyboard data.  Depend on xkb-data.  Thanks to
    Denis Barbier, closes: #359775.
  * Fix a shell syntax error in debian/config.proto that causes
    installation of console-setup to hang on powerpc.  Thanks to Colin
    Watson, closes: #374765.
  * ckbcomp: new option -compact to generate compact keymaps.
  * New experimental package console-setup-mini and udebs for d-i.
  * Correct a typo in the Bulgarian translation.  Thanks to Yavor Doganov,

  [ Anton Zinoviev ]
  * Few comments in debian/templates.
  * Document in console-setup/fontsize-fb template that non 8-pixel wide
    fonts can not be used with console-tools.  Add a warning in setupcon
    if the user tries to use such fonts with console-tools.  Thanks to
    Hans Ulrich Niedermann, closes: #352911.
  * debian/postinst: protect in double quotes the variables read from
    $CONFIGFILE.  Thanks to Jonas Meurer, closes: #353525.
  * ckbcomp: Do not interpret xkeysyms such as F10, F11 and F12 as
    hexadecimal numbers.  Thanks to Bálint Balogh, closes: #354564.
  * Debconf: if there are unrecognised options, do not override the value
    of XKBOPTIONS in /etc/default/console-setup.  Thanks to Javier Kohen,
    closes: #354473.
  * Updated Bulgarian translation.

console-setup (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix some bugs related to non-UTF8 modes:
    - setupcon always sets up the first console in UTF-8 mode
    - setupcon doesn't load ACM in the first console if kbd is used 
    - ckbcomp has to interpret the "acute" Xkeysym as apostrophe.
    Thanks to Norbert Preining, closes: #352449.

 -- Anton Zinoviev <zinoviev@debian.org>  Mon, 13 Feb 2006 21:37:42 +0200

console-setup (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Run setupcon in postinst.  Thanks to Recai Oktaş for the suggestion.
  * Setupcon uses /proc/self/fd/2 (standard error) instead of
    /proc/self/fd/0 (standard output) in order to determine whether we are
    on the console or not.  That way setupcon can detect that we are on
    the console even when it is invoked from postinst and Debconf has
    changed standard input and output.
  * Changes in the text of some questions: "What is the origin of our
    keyboard" instead of "What is the layout of your keyboard" and "What
    is the layout of your keyboard" instead of "What is the variant of
    your keyboard".  Ask the console-setup/variant question with critical
    priority.  Thanks to Arnt Karlsen, closes: #352405.
  * Fix the true/yes discrepancy in setupcon which caused the options -k
    and -f not to work.
  * Updated Bulgarian translation.
