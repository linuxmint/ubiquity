_Description: Font for the console:
 "VGA" has a traditional appearance and has medium coverage of
 international scripts. "Fixed" has a simplistic appearance and has
 better coverage of international scripts. "Terminus" may help to
 reduce eye fatigue, though some symbols have a similar aspect which
 may be a problem for programmers.

 If you prefer a bold version of the Terminus font, choose either
 TerminusBold (if you use a framebuffer) or TerminusBoldVGA (otherwise).
