Template: keyboard-configuration/toggle

# :sl1:
__Choices: Caps Lock, Right Alt (AltGr), Right Control, Right Shift, Right Logo key, Menu key, Alt+Shift, Control+Shift, Control+Alt, Alt+Caps Lock, Left Control+Left Shift, Left Alt, Left Control, Left Shift, Left Logo key, Scroll Lock key, No toggling

_Description: Method for toggling between national and Latin mode:
 You will need a way to toggle the keyboard between the national
 layout and the standard Latin layout.
 .
 Right Alt or Caps Lock keys are often chosen for ergonomic reasons
 (in the latter case, use the combination Shift+Caps Lock for normal Caps
 toggle). Alt+Shift is also a popular combination; it will
 however lose its usual behavior in Emacs and other programs
 that use it for specific needs.
 .
 Not all listed keys are present on all keyboards.

Template: keyboard-configuration/switch
Type: select
# :sl2:
__Choices: No temporary switch, Both Logo keys, Right Alt (AltGr), Right Logo key, Left Alt, Left Logo key
Default: No temporary switch
# :sl2:
_Description: Method for temporarily toggling between national and Latin input:
 When the keyboard is in national mode and one wants to type only a few
 Latin letters, it might be more appropriate to switch temporarily to
 Latin mode. The keyboard remains in that mode as long as the chosen key is
 kept pressed. That key may also be used to input national letters when
 the keyboard is in Latin mode.
 .
 You can disable this feature by choosing "No temporary switch".

# :sl2:
_Description: Key to function as AltGr:

 some characters, primarily ones that are unusual for the language of the
 keyboard layout, such as foreign currency symbols and accented letters.
 These are often printed as an extra symbol on keys.

Type: select
# :sl2:
__Choices: No compose key, Right Alt (AltGr), Right Control, Right Logo key, Menu key, Left Logo key, Caps Lock

_Description: Compose key:

 the next few keystrokes as a combination in order to produce a character
 not found on the keyboard.
 .
 On the text console the Compose key does not work in Unicode mode. If not
 in Unicode mode, regardless of what you choose here, you can always also
 use the Control+period combination as a Compose key.

Template: keyboard-configuration/ctrl_alt_bksp
Type: boolean
Default: false
# :sl3:
