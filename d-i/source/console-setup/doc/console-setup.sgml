<chapt> Basic Structure

<p> The main directory of the package contains a very simple
<file>Makefile</file> &mdash; its main purpose is to invoke the
sub-<file>Makefile</file>s in the directories <file>Fonts</file> and
<file>Keyboard</file>.

<sect> Fonts

<p> Only 256 (or 512) glyphs can be used in the console fonts.  Because
of that it is impossible to use one universal font suitable for all
languages.  So we have to support different font collections for the
different languages.

<p> Maintaining many different font collections has some obious
disadvantages.  First, the look of the console will depend on the
character set.  Second, it is difficult to follow the quality and the
purpose of so many different fonts.  The solution is to maintain
common fonts in BDF format for all languages and translate them to
many fonts in PSF format for the different character sets.

<p> The new console fonts are named after the scheme
<var>CHARSET</var>-<var>FONTFACE</var>.psf, <var>CHARSET</var> may be
for example Arabic, CyrAsia or Lat38 (see <ref id="charsets">) and
<var>FONTFACE</var> can be for example Fixed16.  The number in
<var>FONTFACE</var> represents the number of scan lines in the font.

<sect> Keyboard

<p> The traditional approach for the keyboard support of Linux is not
flexible enough.  All keyboard tables are fixed so even small
customizations of the keyboard layouts require completely new keyboard
definition.  As a result for many of the keyboard layouts there are
many variants that differ only a bit.

<p> Another disadvantage is that the keyboard mappings are not
completely encoding independent.  The kernel does not have knowledge
for all Unicode symbols and can not translate between Unicode and the
legacy 8-bit encodings.

<p> In order to circumvent we use the <prgn>ckbcomp</prgn> utility
which is able to translate the keyboard definitions used in X Window
to keyboard definitions suitable for loadkeys.  See <ref
id="ckbcomp">.

<p> The <prgn>compose_translator</prgn> program generates the compose
sequences from the console.  Invocation:

<example>
./compose_translator --acm acm/<var>ENCODING</var>.acm locale/<var>X_ENCODING</var>/Compose
</example>

Here the file in the <file>acm</file> directory defines the encoding
of the generated compose sequences and the file in the
<file>locale</file> defines the compose sequences in X Window.  The
<file>locale</file> directory is a copy of the X directory
<file>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale</file>.

<sect> <prgn>describe_unicodes</prgn>

<p> The main directory contains the utility
<prgn>describe_unicodes</prgn>.  This utility is never invoked
automatically.  Its purpose is to make files containing many Unicodes
more human-readable.  The following transcript illustrates its usage:

<example>
$ cat foo
U+FFFD U+003F
U+2015 U+2014
U+02C9 U+00AF
$ ./describe_unicodes foo
$ cat foo
U+FFFD U+003F
# U+FFFD:   REPLACEMENT CHARACTER
# U+003F:   QUESTION MARK
U+2015 U+2014
# U+2015:   HORIZONTAL BAR
# U+2014:   EM DASH
U+02C9 U+00AF
# U+02C9:   MODIFIER LETTER MACRON
# U+00AF:   MACRON
</example>

<p> This utility is idempotent, i.e. you can use it as many times as
necessary on one and the same file in order to update the comments.

<chapt><prgn>bdf2psf</prgn>

<p>The program <prgn>bdf2psf</prgn> translates BDF fonts to PSF
format.  It accepts fonts with arbitrary size of the font matrix.  If
the width of matrix of the source font is 7 or 9 pixels then it
generates fonts with width of 8 pixels.

<sect>Synopsis

<p>
<example>
bdf2psf [--fb][--log <var>LOG</var>] <var>BDF</var>{+<var>BDF</var>} <var>EQUIV</var>{+<var>EQUIV</var>} <var>SYMB</var>{+[:]<var>SYMB</var>} <var>SIZE</var> <var>PSF</var> [<var>SFM</var>]
</example>

<p>Description of the options:

<taglist>

<tag><tt>--fb</tt>

<item> Generate fonts for the framebuffer.  There are two important
differences between the framebuffer and the text mode.  First, all
fonts in text mode have to have matrix 8 pixels width.  They also have
to have either 256 or 512 glyphs.  Second, in some text modes the
hardware does some magic in order to use 8 pixels width fonts as if
they were 9 pixels width.  In order to achieve this the video hardware
copyes the 8th column in the 9th columnt of the glyphs with codes from
0xC0 to 0xDF and from 0x1C0 to 0x1DF.  <prgn>Bdf2psf</prgn> is very
careful when deciding where to place a particular glyph and as a
result the encoding of the generated font is more or less arbitrary.

<tag><tt>--log <var>LOG</var></tt>

<item> Record in the file <file><var>LOG</var></file> any problems
during the conversion.

<tag><tt><var>BDF</var>{+<var>BDF</var>}</tt>

<item> The source BDF font(s).  When a particular symbol is defined in
more than one of the specified fonts then the first listed fonts take
precedence.

<tag><tt><var>EQUIV</var>{+<var>EQUIV</var>}</tt>

<item> A list of files defining an equivalence relation between the
glyphs.  See <ref id="equivalence">.

<tag><tt><var>SYMB</var>{+[:]<var>SYMB</var>}</tt>

<item> Generate PSF font for the character set described in the file
<prgn><var>SYMB</var></prgn>.  If more than one character set is
specified the PSF font will support all of them.  When there is no
space for all character sets, the first in the list take precedence.
When a colon before the character set is specified no warnings will be
issued for symbols that could not be placed in the font.  See <ref
id="charsets">.

<tag> <tt><var>SIZE</var></tt>

<item> The size of the PSF font.  Usually 256 or 512 glyphs.

<tag> <tt><var>PSF</var></tt>

<item> <prgn><var>PSF</var></prgn> is the name of the generated PSF
font.  If a file with this name already exists it will be
overwritten.

<tag>  <tt><var>SFM</var></tt>

<item> Save in the file <prgn><var>SFM</var></prgn> the SFM of the
generated font.  This parameter is optional.

</taglist>

<sect id="charsets"> Character Sets

<p> The encoding of the traditional console fonts follows the standard
encoding of the different languages.  For example there are fonts for
all variants of ISO 8859.  This is redundand, for example ISO 8859-1,
ISO 8859-9 and ISO 8859-15 differ only by few characters.

<p> In order to determine the minimal set of character sets a
clustering algorithm was used.  The source code of <url
id="http://proba" name="fontconfig"> contains lists of the characters
that most languages require&mdash;one list per language.  We started
with one character set per language and used the clustering algorithm
in order to join the character sets to bigger.  The following
character sets were the result of the algorithm:

<item> For Vietnamese

</taglist>

<p> These character sets are described in files in the directory
<file>Fonts/fontsets</file>.  These files list the unicodes of the
symbols of the character set, one per line.  Comments starting with a
sharp sign are also allowed.

<p> There two more special character sets in the files
<prgn>required.set</prgn> and <prgn>useful.set</prgn>.  The first of
them lists the symbols that every console font is obligated to
support.  There two classes of obligatory symbols&mdash;the ASCII
symbols and the symbols from the so called alternate character set
(see section "Line Graphics" of <manref name="terminfo" section="5">).
Notice that in order to limit itself to the cp437 character set, the
Linux console driver does some approximations of the symbols from the
alternate character set.  For example it prints U+256A (BOX DRAWINGS
VERTICAL SINGLE AND HORIZONTAL DOUBLE) instead of the not-equal sign.
The file <prgn>required.set</prgn> lists the symbols used by the Linux
console driver (i.e. U+256A instead of the not-equal sign).

<p> In most cases there is more available space in the fonts than
nacessary.  The spare codes are filled with the symbols from the
<prgn>useful.set</prgn> special character set.  On the command line of
<prgn>bdf2psf</prgn> a colon is used before the name of
<prgn>useful.set</prgn> so no warnings are issued if there is no space
in the font for some of these symbols.

<sect id="equivalence">Equivalence files

<p> The equivalence files define an equivalence relation between
unicodes.  The sharp sign is used for comments, the empty lines are
ignored.  All other lines should list two or more unicodes.  Only one
glyph will be allocated in the PSF font for these unicodes.

<p> Example:
<example>
U+2126 U+03A9
# U+2126:   OHM SIGN
# U+03A9:   GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA
U+041D U+0048
# U+041D:   CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER EN
# U+0048:   LATIN CAPITAL LETTER H
</example>

This equivalence file says that U+2126 (the Ohm sign) and U+03A9
(Omega) have the same look so only one glyph is enough for them.  And
also U+041D (Cyrillic En) and U+0048 (Latin H) look the same.

<p> Two equivalence files are
used&mdash;<file>standard.equivalents</file> and
<file>arabic.equivalents</file>.  The first is used for all fonts.
The second is used only for the fonts with character set Uni1, its
purpose is to reduce the number of the necessary glyphs for the Arabic
letters at the cost of the font quality.

<chapt> The Legacy Fonts

<p> The traditionally used font collection for the Linux console is a
demonstration for the big mess.  There are many different fonts and
nobody in the world knew the exact purpose of all of them.  During the
years new fonts were added, but old were almost newer removed.

<p> Some of the fonts shared common typeface, i.e. they were
differently encoded but the common glyphs were equal.  In total,
however, there were too many different typefaces that generally differ
one from another only a little.

<p> In order to resolve this mess the old console fonts were converted
to BDF format.

<sect> Conversion from PSF to BDF

<p> In order to reduce the total number of fonts, they were converted
to BDF format.  During the conversion of the fonts, only one BDF font
was generated for a group of fonts that share common typeface.
Console fonts that didn't have embedded Unicode table were simply
ignored.  The fonts <prgn>LatArCyrHeb*</prgn> were also ignored -
partialy due to technical reasons and partialy because the other BDF
fonts are better source for making Unicode console fonts.

<p> The resulting BDF fonts are named after the scheme
<prgn>legacy<var>NNp</var>.bdf</prgn>, where <var>NN</var> is 8, 10,
12, 14, 16 or 19 (the number of scan lines of the font, i.e. the font
matrix is 8x<var>NN</var>) and p is a, b, c, d, e,... and serves to
ensure the uniqueness of the file names.  Some of the resulting BDF
fonts were produced by only one source PSF font (for example only
<prgn>iso06.f08.psf</prgn> was used to produce
<prgn>legacy8d.bdf</prgn>) while for others it was possible to
incorporate the glyphs from more than one PSF font (for example six
different PSF fonts were used to produce <prgn>legacy16e.bdf</prgn>).

<p> The following table documents the correspondence between the file
names of the resulting BDF fonts and the names of the original PSF
fonts:

<sect> Back Conversion&mdash;from BDF to PSF

<p> Only one PSF font per combination of charset-size is generated
from the legacy fonts.  This font is named after the scheme
<var>CHARSET</var>-vga<var>SIZE</var>.psf.  For example
<file>Greek-vga14.psf</file> is the legacy font for Greek character
set and size 14.  The list of BDF fonts that is used to produce
Greek-vga14.psf was determined as folows.

<p> First, see which one of the legacy BDF fonts can provide as many
glyphs for <file>Greek-vga14.psf</file> as possible.  This was
<file>legacy14g.bdf</file> (produced from <prgn>iso07.f14.psf</prgn>).
Then see which one of the other legacy BDF fonts provides as much
glyphs for <file>Greek-vga14.psf</file> that <prgn>legacy14g</prgn>
does not provide.  And so on.  The resulting lists are represented as
<tt>Charset-legacy<var>SIZE</var>-<var>BDFS</var></tt> targets in the
<prgn>Makefile</prgn>.  It is perfectly OK to handtune them.  For
example if one decides that the look of <file>legacy16i.bdf</file> is
superior it is OK to list <file>legacy16i.bdf</file> as primary font
for <file>Lat15-vga16.psf</file> even though
<file>legacy16c.bdf</file> provides more glyphs.

<p> There is one exception to the previous paragraph: the wonderful
font <prgn>UNI_VGA</prgn> of Dmitry Bolkhovityanov was always used as
a primary font for the <prgn>vga16</prgn> fontface.

<p> The targets <tt>VGA<var>SIZE</var>-CHARSET</tt> in the
<prgn>Makefile</prgn> specify which charsets are suitable for a
particular font size.  We see that for some of the sizes only the
Lat15 and Lat2 charsets are supported by the traditional fonts.  The
following charsets are completely unsupported by the traditional
console fonts: Armenian, CyrAsia, Georgian, Lao, Thai and Vietnamese.

<p> The Ethiopian fonts <file>Goha??.bdf</file> and
<file>GohaClasic??.bdf</file> are not used as legacy fonts.  In all
currently available non-console BDF fonts the Ethiopian letters are
double-width and can not be used on the console.  Thats why these
fonts are treated equaly to the other non-legacy BDF fonts.

<chapt> The New Fonts

<p> Even for the new PSF fonts it is not wise to use a single BDF
source.  Many of the BDF fonts share a common look. For example the X
font <prgn>fixed</prgn> was used by Roman Czyborra in order to create
his <prgn>unifont.bdf</prgn>.  The same font was used also by
Electronic Font Open Laboratory for their <prgn>h16.bdf</prgn> and by
the former Electrotechnical Laboratory (now National Institute of
Advanced Industrial Science Technology, Japan) for their
<prgn>etl16-unicode.bdf</prgn> font.

<p> The targets <tt><var>FONTFACE</var>-BDFS</tt> in the
<prgn>Makefile</prgn> specify the BDF fonts to use in order to
generate the PSF font fonts.  For example the combination
"<tt>unifont.bdf</tt> + <tt>h16.bdf</tt> + <tt>etl16-unicode.bdf</tt>"
is used for the Fixed16 font face.  The fonts listed first take
precedence, so it is wise to list first the fonts which symbols look
better and not the fonts with more symbols.

<p> The <prgn>bdf</prgn> directory contains almost all free BDF fonts
that can be used to generate console fonts.  Currently they allow to
generate fonts from the following font faces: Fixed13, Fixed14,
Fixed15, Fixed16, Fixed18, Fixed24x12, FixedBold13, FixedBold14,
FixedBold15, FixedBold16, FixedBold18, FixedBold24x12, FixedOblique13,
Terminus12x6, Terminus14, Terminus16, Terminus24x12, Terminus20x10,
Terminus28x14, Terminus32x16, TerminusBold12x6, TerminusBold14,
TerminusBold16, TerminusBold20x10, TerminusBold24x12,
TerminusBold28x14, TerminusBold32x16, TerminusBoldVGA14,
TerminusBoldVGA16, Courier13, Courier14, Courier15, Courier16,
CourierBold13, CourierBold14, CourierBold15, Lucid12, Lucid13,
Lucid15, Lucid16, Lucid22x12, Lucid29x16, LucidBold11, LucidBold13,
LucidBold15, LucidBold16, LucidBold22x12, LucidBold29x16, Goha12,
Goha14, Goha16, GohaClassic12, GohaClassic14 and GohaClassic16.

<p> The targets in the <prgn>Makefile</prgn> are able to generate a
PSF font for every <var>CHARSET</var>-<var>FONTFACE</var> combination.
The <prgn>build</prgn> target however will generate fonts only for the
"good" combinations.

<p> First, the program <file>fontcodesets</file> is used to determine
which charsets a particular font face supports.  The result is stored
in the file <file>soft.Makefile</file> where the variable
<prgn>PSF_FONTS</prgn> is defined and it is directly included in the
main <prgn>Makefile</prgn>.  Use the target <prgn>soft.Makefile</prgn>
in order to update this file (this doesn't happen automatically).

<p> Second, some of the font faces are not generated because they do
not look very attractive on the console (certainly the choice is a
personal opinion).  Only the following font faces are approved:
Fixed13, Fixed14, Fixed15, Fixed16, Fixed18, Terminus12x6, Terminus14,
Terminus16, Terminus24x12, Terminus20x10, Terminus28x14,
Terminus32x16, TerminusBold12x6, TerminusBold14, TerminusBold16,
TerminusBold20x10, TerminusBold24x12, TerminusBold28x14,
TerminusBold32x16, TerminusBoldVGA14, TerminusBoldVGA16, Goha12,
Goha14, Goha16, GohaClassic12, GohaClassic14 and GohaClassic16.  See
the <prgn>GOOD_PSF_FONTS</prgn> variable in the <prgn>Makefile</prgn>.

<chapt id="ckbcomp"> The <prgn>ckbcomp</prgn> Utility

<p> The <prgn>ckbcomp</prgn> accepts more or less the same arguments
as the <prgn>setxkbmap</prgn> utility:

<example>

Where legal args are:
-?,-help            Print this message
-charmap &lt;name&gt;         Specifies the encoding to use
-I&lt;dir&gt;             Add &lt;dir&gt; to list of directories to be used
-keycodes &lt;name&gt;    Specifies keycodes component name
-symbols &lt;name&gt;     Specifies symbols component name
-rules &lt;name&gt;       Name of rules file to use
-model &lt;name&gt;       Specifies model used to choose component names

</example>

<p> The main difference is the <prgn>-charmap</prgn> parameter which
specifies the encoding to use.  If the encoding is <var>ENC</var> then
one of the following files should exist:

<list>
<item><file><var>ENC</var></file>
<item><file><var>ENC</var>.gz</file>
<item><file><var>ENC</var>.acm</file>
<item><file><var>ENC</var>.acm.gz</file>
<item><file> /usr/share/consoletrans/<var>ENC</var></file>
<item><file>/usr/share/consoletrans/<var>ENC</var>.gz</file>
<item><file>/usr/share/consoletrans/<var>ENC</var>.acm</file>
<item><file>/usr/share/consoletrans/<var>ENC</var>.acm.gz</file>
<item><file>acm/<var>ENC</var>.acm</file>
</list>

This file should define the so called Application Character Map for
<var>ENC</var>.

<p> The option <prgn>-I</prgn> add a directory to the list of
directories where the X keyboard definitions are searched.  By default
this directory list contains the following directories:

<list>
<item><file>/etc/console-setup/ckb</file>
<item><file>/etc/X11/xkb</file>
<item><file>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb</file>
</list>
