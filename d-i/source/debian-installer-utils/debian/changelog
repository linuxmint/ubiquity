      noninteractive to installed system.
    - Use /proc/self/fd/4 rather than /dev/fd/4 in fetch-url-methods/http;

  * Record mountpoints immediately after mounting /target/proc, /target/sys,
    etc.  Add a chroot_cleanup_localmounts function to chroot-setup.sh which
    differs from chroot_cleanup in that it undoes just these mounts rather
    than checking for others created since chroot_setup was called, mainly
    for use by apt-setup.

  * Note that search-path is deprecated, as 'type' can generally do the job
    just as well. (If you find a case where it can't, please tell me.)
  * Add list-devices, which can be used to list all devices of a given type
    (currently cd, disk, floppy, and a weird maybe-floppy type to handle
    mountfloppy's needs). Once udevinfo is added to udev-udeb (bug filed),
    this can be used to avoid devfs path assumptions.

    - Don't output init=* from user-params; supplying it to the first stage

      shell builtin!)

      levels are the ones who need to read it most, probably.
    - Simplified rules file; use dh_builddeb, dh_gencontrol.
    - Break shell back out of the multicall binary (which is now a single-call
      binary, whee!), and make di-utils-shell use a compiled postinst.

      soon.
