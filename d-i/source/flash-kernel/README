flash-kernel
------------

flash-kernel is a script which will put the kernel and initramfs in
the boot location of embedded devices that don't load the kernel and
initramfs directly from /boot.  flash-kernel supports devices that
boot from flash memory (hence the name) as well as some devices that
require a special boot image on the disk.

Testsuite
- - - - -

Run the testsuite with:
    FK_CHECKOUT=. ./test_flash-kernel
    FK_CHECKOUT=. ./test_functions

You need the devscripts package for the checkbashisms test.


Database format
- - - - - - - -

To accomodate the differences between machines, db/*.db files contain
information on supported machines.  The files look somewhat like
RFC 2822 data or Debian control data, i.e. header: value pairs,
with definitions separated by an empty line.  Comments starting with a
pound are ignored.

The supported fields are:

* Machine: (required) value of the "Hardware:" line in /proc/cpuinfo and
  is used as an unique identifier

* Kernel-Flavors: (optional) allowed flavors (suffixes) for the to be
  installed kernel; if the vmlinuz file doesn't end with a listed
  suffix, installation is aborted

* Machine-Id: (optional) linux mach-type to set before starting vmlinuz;
  will be set by a small piece of ARM code prepended to the kernel image

* U-Boot-Kernel-Address, U-Boot-Initrd-Address: (optional) address where
  to load in (physical) RAM the kernel and initrd, respectively; this
  also indicates that U-Boot images should be generated with mkimage

* U-Boot-Script-Address: (optional) like U-Boot-Kernel-Address and
  U-Boot-Initrd-Address but for an U-Boot boot script; see also
  U-Boot-Script-Name

* U-Boot-Script-Name: (optional) name of U-Boot boot script to install
  from the flash-kernel files

* Boot-Kernel-Path, Boot-Initrd-Path: (optional) where to put the
  generated kernel and initrd files on the filesystem; see also
  Boot-Device

* Boot-Script-Path: (optional) like Boot-Kernel-Path and
  Boot-Initrd-Path but for an U-Boot boot script; see also
  U-Boot-Script-Name and Boot-Device

* Boot-Dtb-Path: (optional) where to put the DTB file on the filesystem;
  see also DTB-Id

* Required-packages: (optional) list of packages which must be added
  during installer phase for flash-kernel to work properly; failure to
  add these packages aborts the installation

* Optional-Packages: (optional) list of packages which should be
  added during installer pharse for flash-kernel to offer full
  functionality; failure to add these packages just triggers a warning

* Bootloader-sets-root: (required) when "yes" indicates that the
  bootloader passes a root= value to the kernel and that this should be
  overriden in the initrd; when "no", flash-kernel only sets a default
  value for the root device, which allows end-users to pass root= to
  the kernel

* Method: (optional) indicates how to support this particular machine;
  the default is "generic"; other available methods are: android, multi,
  redboot, slug, symlink

* Boot-Device: (optional) block device to mount before installing
  kernel,  initrd and U-Boot script; Boot-Kernel-Path, Boot-Initrd-Path and
  Boot-Script-Path are then taken relative to this boot device

* DTB-Kernel-Version: (optional) minimal kernel version for DTB concatenation

* DTB-Id: (optional) specifies the name of the DTB file for this device
