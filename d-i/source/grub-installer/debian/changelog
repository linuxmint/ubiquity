  * Resynchronise with Debian.  Remaining changes:
    - Show the grub menu and raise the menu timeout if other operating
      systems are installed (only for GRUB Legacy right now).
    - Remove splash boot parameter unless debian-installer/framebuffer=true
      and debian-installer/splash=true.
    - If / or /boot are on a removable device, install GRUB there by
      default.
    - Support setting OVERRIDE_UNSUPPORTED_OS in the environment to force
      grub-installer to use its default MBR selection method despite there
      being unsupported operating systems on the disk.
    - Handle cases where /boot is bind-mounted.
    - Add support for writing an GRUB Legacy MBR on each disk in an
      mdadm-managed RAID providing /boot.  (GRUB 2 can handle this already.)
    - Properly make use of output from os-prober to configure the booting of
      other operating systems on dmraid arrays.  Attempt to guess where in
      the device map the array belongs, by substituting the first drive in
      the dmraid array for the dmraid array device node itself, and removing
      any reference to other member disks of the array.
    - Go back to using update-grub -y for GRUB Legacy for now; our grub
      package is a bit old and still requires this.
    - Allow grub/grub2 choice for ext4, though still default to grub2.
    - If /boot is on an MD device and we're using GRUB 2, install GRUB there
      rather than (hd0); GRUB 2 will interpret that as meaning that it needs
      to install to each of the RAID members.
    - If using GRUB 2 and installing to a RAID device any of whose
      components are partitions, then default to installing to the MBRs of
      each of the containing disks, since GRUB 2 will refuse to install to
      the partition devices.
    - On i386/efi and amd64/efi subarchitectures, install grub-efi and purge
      grub, grub-legacy, and grub-pc; elsewhere, purge grub-efi*.
    - Add a preseedable grub-installer/timeout template to adjust the
      initial GRUB timeout.
    - Install GRUB to the SATA RAID or multipath device when /boot is on
      such a device, rather than installing to the first hard disk.
    - Remove grub-gfxpayload-lists in situations where we need to remove
      grub-pc.
    - Remove 'quiet' from target system command line if
      debian-installer/quiet is set to false.
    - When /boot is on a loopback device (i.e. Wubi), install GRUB there.
    - Simplify /proc and /sys mounting; make sure they're consistently
      mounted for the entire life of grub-installer, and consistently
      unmounted on exit.
    - Only process the output of os-prober into boot menu entries if we're
      actually going to use them; if we're using GRUB 2 and os-prober is
      installed, then it will deal with this itself and do a better job of
      it.
  * Drop grub-installer/bootdev_directory preseeding.  Wubi no longer uses
    this, and we no longer care about grub4dos.

  * Resynchronise with Debian.  Remaining changes:
    - Show the grub menu and raise the menu timeout if other operating
      systems are installed (only for GRUB Legacy right now).
    - Remove splash boot parameter unless debian-installer/framebuffer=true
      and debian-installer/splash=true.
    - If / or /boot are on a removable device, install GRUB there by
      default.
    - Only mount /target/proc if it isn't already mounted.
    - Support setting OVERRIDE_UNSUPPORTED_OS in the environment to force
      grub-installer to use its default MBR selection method despite there
      being unsupported operating systems on the disk.
    - Unless grub-installer/make_active is preseeded to false, mark the
      partition to which GRUB is being installed as bootable, or failing
      that the first available primary partition on the disk to which GRUB
      is being installed.
    - Support grub-installer/bootdev_directory preseeding to make use of the
      relative path feature of grub4dos, so that we can point grub4dos at
      part of a disk for Wubi. Setting this disables normal grub
      installation, but still generates a device.map (for GRUB Legacy only);
      it also hides the menu.
    - Handle cases where /boot is bind-mounted.
    - Add support for writing an GRUB Legacy MBR on each disk in an
      mdadm-managed RAID providing /boot. (GRUB 2 can handle this already.)
    - Properly make use of output from os-prober to configure the booting of
      other operating systems on dmraid arrays. Attempt to guess where in
      the device map the array belongs, by substituting the first drive in
      the dmraid array for the dmraid array device node itself, and removing
      any reference to other member disks of the array.
    - Go back to using update-grub -y for GRUB Legacy for now; our grub
      package is a bit old and still requires this.
    - Default to grub2 for GPT systems.
    - Allow grub/grub2 choice for ext4, though still default to grub2.
    - If /boot is on an MD device and we're using GRUB 2, install GRUB there
      rather than (hd0); GRUB 2 will interpret that as meaning that it needs
      to install to each of the RAID members.
    - If using GRUB 2 and installing to a RAID device any of whose
      components are partitions, then default to installing to the MBRs of
      each of the containing disks, since GRUB 2 will refuse to install to
      the partition devices.
    - Bind-mount /proc and /sys while running grub-install.
    - Update grub-installer/bootdev text to avoid GRUB device naming that

    - Don't ask for a boot device on EFI, and don't pass a boot device

    - Set a sensible default boot device, so that we aren't installing GRUB
      to installation media which may be removed later.  The disk containing
      /cdrom is very unlikely to be a sensible default.  If we had to fall
      back to (hd0), then we can't tell exactly which disk that is, but if
      /cdrom seems to be a USB stick then (hd0) may not be safe.  If we hit
      either of those checks, then try the disk containing /boot instead
      (closes: #568529).

grub-installer (1.49ubuntu10) lucid; urgency=low

  * Historically, Ubuntu's default behaviour in the absence of command-line
    arguments to the installer has been to pass 'splash' to the installed
    system so that it gets a splash screen (and similarly 'quiet').  There's
    some argument that this behaviour should require passing 'splash' to the
    installer as well, but it's too late in the Lucid cycle for this change.
    Nevertheless, we need a way to configure images such that they don't get
    'splash' in the installed system, so introduce a 'nosplash' argument
    which inhibits this, for use by the server CD (LP: #548954).

grub-installer (1.49ubuntu9) lucid; urgency=low

  * Ask grub-installer/only_debian at high priority again (LP: #47135).
    Originally, in Warty, we ensured that this question wouldn't be visible
    by default to support simple installations of Ubuntu with as few
    questions as possible.  However, since then, we wrote Ubiquity, which
    has taken over responsibility for the simple installation case, and it's
    become clear that automatically installing GRUB to the first disk's MBR
    is inadequate for many more complex situations.  Ironically, Ubiquity
    makes this option easily accessible from the "Advanced" dialog box, but
    Ubuntu's d-i required a special boot parameter to display it.
  * Update grub-installer/bootdev text to avoid GRUB device naming that
    changed between GRUB Legacy and GRUB 2, and to use libata-style device
    naming since that is more accurate for most people (LP: #391775)

grub-installer (1.49ubuntu1) lucid; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Show the grub menu and raise the menu timeout if other operating
      systems are installed (only for GRUB Legacy right now).
    - Ask grub-installer/only_debian at medium priority.
    - Remove splash boot parameter unless debian-installer/framebuffer=true.
    - If / or /boot are on a removable device, install GRUB there by
      default.
    - Only mount /target/proc if it isn't already mounted.
    - Support setting OVERRIDE_UNSUPPORTED_OS in the environment to force
      grub-installer to use its default MBR selection method despite there
      being unsupported operating systems on the disk.
    - Unless grub-installer/make_active is preseeded to false, mark the
      partition to which GRUB is being installed as bootable, or failing
      that the first available primary partition on the disk to which GRUB
      is being installed.
    - Support grub-installer/bootdev_directory preseeding to make use of the
      relative path feature of grub4dos, so that we can point grub4dos at
      part of a disk for Wubi. Setting this disables normal grub
      installation, but still generates a device.map (for GRUB Legacy only);
      it also hides the menu.
    - Handle cases where /boot is bind-mounted.
    - Add support for writing an GRUB Legacy MBR on each disk in an
      mdadm-managed RAID providing /boot. (GRUB 2 can handle this already.)
    - Properly make use of output from os-prober to configure the booting of
      other operating systems on dmraid arrays. Attempt to guess where in
      the device map the array belongs, by substituting the first drive in
      the dmraid array for the dmraid array device node itself, and removing
      any reference to other member disks of the array.
    - Set a sensible default boot device when /cdrom is not iso9660, as this
      is probably a USB install and (hd0) does not make sense when
      installing from a removable disk.
    - Go back to using update-grub -y for GRUB Legacy for now; our grub
      package is a bit old and still requires this.
    - Default to grub2 for GPT systems.
    - Allow grub/grub2 choice for ext4, though still default to grub2.
    - If /boot is on an MD device and we're using GRUB 2, install GRUB there
      rather than (hd0); GRUB 2 will interpret that as meaning that it needs
      to install to each of the RAID members.
    - Mount /target/sys when running update-grub.
    - If using GRUB 2 and installing to a RAID device any of whose
      components are partitions, then default to installing to the MBRs of
      each of the containing disks, since GRUB 2 will refuse to install to
      the partition devices.

    - Support grub-installer/bootdev_directory preseeding to make use of the
      relative path feature of grub4dos, so that we can point grub4dos at
      part of a disk for Wubi. Setting this disables normal grub
      installation, but still generates a device.map; it also hides the
      menu.
    - Handle cases where /boot is bind-mounted.
    - Add support for writing an GRUB Legacy MBR on each disk in an
      mdadm-managed RAID providing /boot. (GRUB 2 can handle this already.)
    - Properly make use of output from os-prober to configure the booting of
      other operating systems on dmraid arrays. Attempt to guess where in
      the device map the array belongs, by substituting the first drive in
      the dmraid array for the dmraid array device node itself, and removing
      any reference to other member disks of the array.
    - Add support for lpia.
    - Set a sensible default boot device when /cdrom is not iso9660, as this
      is probably a USB install and (hd0) does not make sense when
      installing from a removable disk.
    - Go back to using update-grub -y for GRUB Legacy for now; our grub
      package is a bit old and still requires this.
    - Default to grub2 for GPT systems.
    - Allow grub/grub2 choice for ext4, though still default to grub2.

grub-installer (1.32ubuntu1) intrepid; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Show the grub menu and raise the menu timeout if other operating
      systems are installed.
    - Ask grub-installer/only_debian at medium priority.
    - Remove splash boot parameter unless debian-installer/framebuffer=true.
    - If / or /boot are on a removable device, install GRUB there by
      default.
    - Only mount /target/proc if it isn't already mounted.
    - Support setting OVERRIDE_UNSUPPORTED_OS in the environment to force
      grub-installer to use its default MBR selection method despite there
      being unsupported operating systems on the disk.
    - Unless grub-installer/make_active is preseeded to false, mark the
      partition to which GRUB is being installed as bootable, or failing
      that the first available primary partition on the disk to which GRUB
      is being installed.
    - Support grub-installer/bootdev_directory preseeding to make use of the
      relative path feature of grub4dos, so that we can point grub4dos at
      part of a disk for installation-from-windows. Setting this disables
      normal grub installation, but still generates a device.map.
    - Only support grub-installer/grub2_instead_of_grub_legacy by preseeding
      for now.
    - Handle cases where /boot is bind-mounted.

grub-installer (1.19ubuntu1) feisty; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Show the grub menu and raise the menu timeout if other operating
      systems are installed.
    - Ask grub-installer/only_debian at medium priority.
    - Remove splash boot parameter unless debian-installer/framebuffer=true.
    - If / or /boot are on a removable device, install GRUB there by
      default.
    - Only mount /target/proc if it isn't already mounted.
    - Add user parameters to defoptions rather than kopt, so that they
      aren't used in the recovery mode option (closes: Malone #31905).
    - Support setting OVERRIDE_UNSUPPORTED_OS in the environment to force
      grub-installer to use its default MBR selection method despite there
      being unsupported operating systems on the disk.

  * Disable the option to select grub2 for the Etch release as it was only
