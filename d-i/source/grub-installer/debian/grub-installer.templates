_Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record?
 The following other operating systems have been detected on this
 computer: ${OS_LIST}
 .
 If all of your operating systems are listed above, then it should be safe to
 install the boot loader to the master boot record of your first hard
 drive. When your computer boots, you will be able to choose to load one of
 these operating systems or your new system.

_Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record?
 It seems that this new installation is the only operating system
 on this computer. If so, it should be safe to install the GRUB boot loader
 to the master boot record of your first hard drive.
 .
 Warning: If the installer failed to detect another operating system that
 is present on your computer, modifying the master boot record will make
 that operating system temporarily unbootable, though GRUB can be manually
 configured later to boot it.

Type: boolean
Default: true
# :sl3:
_Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to the Serial ATA RAID disk?
 Installation of GRUB on Serial ATA RAID is experimental.
 .
 GRUB is always installed to the master boot record (MBR) of the
 Serial ATA RAID disk. It is also assumed that disk is listed as the
 first hard disk in the boot order defined in the system's BIOS setup.
 .
 The GRUB root device is: ${GRUBROOT}.

# :sl3:
_Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to the multipath device?
 Installation of GRUB on multipath is experimental.
 .
 GRUB is always installed to the master boot record (MBR) of the multipath
 device. It is also assumed that the WWID of this device is selected as boot
 device in the system's FibreChannel adapter BIOS.
 .
 The GRUB root device is: ${GRUBROOT}.

Template: grub-installer/bootdev
Type: string
# :sl2:
_Description: Device for boot loader installation:
 You need to make the newly installed system bootable, by installing
 the GRUB boot loader on a bootable device. The usual way to do this is to
 install GRUB on the master boot record of your first hard drive. If you
 prefer, you can install GRUB elsewhere on the drive, or to another drive,
 or even to a floppy.
 .
 The device should be specified as a device in /dev. Below are some
 examples:
  - "/dev/sda" will install GRUB to the master boot record of your first
    hard drive;
  - "/dev/sda2" will use the second partition of your first hard drive;
  - "/dev/sdc5" will use the first extended partition of your third hard
    drive;
  - "/dev/fd0" will install GRUB to a floppy.

Template: grub-installer/password
Type: password
# :sl2:
_Description: GRUB password:
 The GRUB boot loader offers many powerful interactive features, which could
 be used to compromise your system if unauthorized users have access to the
 machine when it is starting up. To defend against this, you may choose a
 password which will be required before editing menu entries or entering the
 GRUB command-line interface. By default, any user will still be able to
 start any menu entry without entering the password.
 .
 If you do not wish to set a GRUB password, leave this field blank.

_Description: Install GRUB?
 GRUB 2 is the next generation of GNU GRUB, the boot loader that is commonly
 used on i386/amd64 PCs. It is now also available for ${ARCH}.
 .
 It has interesting new features but is still experimental software
 for this architecture. If you choose to install it, you should be prepared
 for breakage, and have an idea on how to recover your system if it
 becomes unbootable. You're advised not to try this in production
 environments.
