  * Resynchronise with Debian.  Remaining changes:
    - Remove FireWire Ethernet support.
    - Register lp module on i386 and amd64.
    - Exit zero if you continue all the way through ethdetect's errors about
      having no network interfaces.
    - Register rtc module on amd64.
    - Drop priorities of a couple of ethdetect questions to medium.
    - disk-detect.sh: Do not check the kernel command line for any option
      to enable dmraid support. If functional dmraid arrays are found, the
      user will be asked if they wish to activate them.
    - Make dmraid logging a bit neater.
    - 'dmraid -c -s' changed its output format; cope with both old and new.
    - Remove dm-emc from the multipath modules, since it's gone since
      2.6.27.
    - Improve checks for dm-* drivers being present to avoid relying on them
      being built as modules.
    - Offer iSCSI targets for preseeding if partman-iscsi is available and
      no disk devices are found.
    - Stop installing acpi, acpid, and acpi-support-base if acpi is
      available.
    - Add an 'archdetect-deb' package, containing /usr/bin/archdetect.  Add
      an archdetect(1) manual page.
    - Refer to /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2 in debian/copyright.
    - Load xenbus_probe_frontend if we're running under the Xen hypervisor.
    - Redirect update-dev output to /dev/null, as it is in principle
      possible for it to write to stdout and that would interfere with
      debconf.
  * Drop changes for PS3 and Cell, since we haven't been able to support
    these platforms for some time.

  * Move firmware/injected drivers' .deb packages installation from
    post-base-installer.d stage to pre-pkgsel.d stage. (LP: #1209287, LP:
    #1216043)
  * Bump question to load driver injection disk from medium to high, and
    raise driver-injection-disk package priority to standard. Thus the
    udeb will be loaded by default, but before installing any debs from
    the OEMDRV a confirmation question will be asked (default true, can be
    pre-seeded)

hw-detect (1.65) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Look for firmware files in a firmware subdirectory of the media, 
    as well as at the top level, for neat freaks.
  * Call check-missing-firmware at the end of ethdetect and disk-detect,
    as those programs can manually load modules, that could need firmware too.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Starting with initramfs-tools 0.92d the module ide-generic will be loaded
    if the all_generic_ide parameter is passed. Advantage is that with that
    option the module is loaded last instead of first.
  * If the megaraid_mbox driver is in use, wait for the RAID hardware
    initialization to finish before proceeding with the installation and add
    the 'rootdelay' boot parameter for the target system. Closes: #486298.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * ethdetect: Some modules do not request firmware until their interface
    has been brought up. So up and down every interface so missing firmware
    can be detected. Closes: #491712
  * check-missing-firmware: Don't display dups. Closes: #492246
  * check-missing-firmware: Check that debs are the right architecture before
    trying to use them. Closes: #492249
  * post-base-installer: If dpkg fails to install a firmware package, likely
    because it has dependencies outside base, remove it rather than leaving
    the db in an inconsistent state. Note that bugs have been filed to get all
    such firmware packages fixed. Closes: #492248
  * check-missing-firmware: Avoid trailing space in $files that caused it to
    look for firmware packages containing a file named "" (and probably match
    any package). Closes: #492247
  * check-missing-firmware: Add a 1 second sleep before reading the missing
    firmware log, just in case a module delays requesting firmware
    until after modprobe returns, resulting in the log not being written in
    time. (No such modules currently known.)
  * hw-detect: Fix syntax error in code added for #472487.
  * Add test for syntax errors in scripts to build process.

    /tmp/missing-firmware.
  * Add check-missing-firmware.
  * Add a post-base-installer hook to install firmware into /target.
    Closes: #487228
  * If firmware debs are installed, default apt-setup to using non-free.
    This is so that apt can upgrade those debs.
  * RM note: udev-udeb 0.124-1 has dropped the firmware.agent, so needs
    this version of hw-detect. This version of hw-detect will work with
    older versions of udev-udeb, although it will be indetermanate whether the

  * Colin Watson
    - Don't install pcmcia-cs if hw-detect/start_pcmcia=false; at least on
      2.6 kernels, the /sys nodes can end up being present even if PCMCIA
      hasn't been started (Ubuntu bug #8678).
    - Fix DEB_HOST_ARCH_* compatibility code to handle the various special
      cases.
  * Joey Hess
    - Rename hw-detect-full to disk-detect.
    - Add a disk-detect command, which uses hw-detect to load any additional
      drivers, as hw-detect-full did, but which also checks to see if any
      disks were found, and if none are, allows the user to select driver
      modules from a list, or load more from a floppy. Closes: #283193
    - disk-detect will use partman's parted_devices command if available to
      see if any disks are found. Otherwise it falls back to a devfs find
      similar to that used by partitioner and autopartkit. This is probably
      good enough, but partman could be extended for network filesystems or
      something else and disk-detect's check would not know about it.
    - Move retry_params template to hw-detect so disk-detect can use it too.
      hw-detect might also use it in the future. Same with load_floppy
      template.
    - Remove ethdetect/modprobe_error template, as it's identical to
      hw-detect/modprobe_error. Use the latter in ethdetect.
    - Direct some modprobe output to /var/log/messages in ethdetect as is done
      in hw-detect.
    - Add a cleanup function to ethdetect.
    - Rename the source package as it's going through NEW anyway.

      a state machine of some kind here.
    - mac-io bus detection improvements:
      + Detect mesh SCSI controller (closes: #269655, #271419).
      + Detect mace Ethernet controller.
      + Detect mac53c94 SCSI controller.
      + Detect therm_adt746x and therm_windtunnel fan controllers, although
        only post-reboot for now since those modules aren't in
        linux-kernel-di-powerpc-*.
      + Cope with /proc/device-tree/aliases/mac-io pointing to a symlink.

      selected from the manual list. The previous method didn't work
      since many media lack a menu item to load floppies. Closes: #247941
    - BTW, think "firmware floppy". :-(
    - Always autodetect network hardware. The question about whether to do
      this was asked as low priority; hw-detect is safe and always asks at low
      priority before loading modules, so the question was redundant.
      Closes: #219890

    - hw-detect can now be called with a parameter that is the name of a
      debconf template. If it is, it will use that template as the title 
      for the progress bar. This allows for cusomised progress bars
      during the different hardware detection steps. Of course, it's kinda a
      gyp because hw-detect still loads all the modules it can in each pass.

    - Remove the bogus "false" from the end of the modprobe error message
      display.
    - Sort the list of modules for manual selection.
    - Use register-module to register modules for ide and scsi CDROMS,
      so they will be available for base-config.
    - Use register-module to register any module parameters that are entered
      by the user.
    - Fix ethdetect to not write kernel module parameters to
      /target/etc/modules; instead use register-module here too.
    - Add a versioned dep on rootskel.
    - Based on user reports, users are very confused to see the missing
      modules dialog for stuff like ide-floppy, which is both unavailable
      and not autodetected. So leave off non-autodetectable modules from the
      missing modules message.

    - Check for already loaded modules before saying anything about loading
      them. Should be faster and clearer.
    - If a module is not available, don't say we're loading it, instead
      mention that it was unavailable. The summary of unavailable modules is
      retained because it's easy to miss otherwise.
    - Remove the "(full version)" from hw-detect-full's menu item.
      There is no other version on the menu.
    - Versioned dependencies are not allowed in udebs, removed version from

    - Remove the confusing question about manually specifying the module to
      load. Anyone who knows where a non-modprobe-able module is can use the
      shell..
    - Remove redundant ethdetect/title template, and unused
      ethdetect/module_prompt template.
    - hw-detect: collect any modprobe failures, and show them all in one
      screen at the end. Closes: #215163
    - hw-detect: Say "Loading module", not "Detected module", as not all
      the loaded modules were detected.
