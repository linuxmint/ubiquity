_Description: Modules to load:
 The following Linux kernel modules were detected as matching your
 hardware. If you know some are unnecessary, or cause problems, you can
 choose not to load them. If you're unsure, you should leave them all
 selected.

Template: hw-detect/start_pcmcia
Type: boolean
Default: true
# FIXME: not in use and kept just while we're still in doubt it will
#        be needed
# :sl2:
_Description: Start PC card services?
 Please choose whether PC card services should be started in order to allow
 the use of PCMCIA cards.

Template: hw-detect/pcmcia_resources
Type: string
# :sl2:
_Description: PCMCIA resource range options:
 Some PCMCIA hardware needs special resource configuration options in
 order to work, and can cause the computer to freeze otherwise. For
 example, some Dell laptops need "exclude port 0x800-0x8ff" to be
 specified here. These options will be added to /etc/pcmcia/config.opts.
 See the installation manual or the PCMCIA HOWTO for more information.
 .
 For most hardware, you do not need to specify anything here.

Template: hw-detect/retry_params
Type: string
# :sl3:
_Description: Additional parameters for module ${MODULE}:
 The module ${MODULE} failed to load. You may need to pass parameters
 to the module to make it work; this is common with older hardware.
 These parameters are often I/O port and IRQ numbers that vary from machine
 to machine and cannot be determined from the hardware. An example string
 looks something like "irq=7 io=0x220"
 .
 If you don't know what to enter, consult your documentation, or leave it
 blank to not load the module.

Template: hw-detect/modprobe_error
Type: error

_Description: Error while running '${CMD_LINE_PARAM}'

Template: hw-detect/load_media
Type: boolean
Default: false
# :sl2:
_Description: Load missing drivers from removable media?
 A driver for your hardware is not available. You may need
 to load drivers from removable media, such as a USB stick, or driver floppy.
 .
 If you have such media available now, insert it, and continue.

Template: hw-detect/load_firmware
Type: boolean
Default: true
# :sl2:
_Description: Load missing firmware from removable media?
 Some of your hardware needs non-free firmware files to operate. The
 firmware can be loaded from removable media, such as a USB stick or
 floppy.
 .
 The missing firmware files are: ${FILES}
 .
 If you have such media available now, insert it, and continue.
