migration-assistant (0.6.2) intrepid; urgency=low

  * Several fixes from Olivier Blin of Mandriva:
    - Close file descriptors when they're no longer needed.
    - Move a closedir() call, it can free data returned by readdir() too
      early.  It leads to path corruption in some cases.
    - Fix a segfault with files with no extension.
    - Remove a spurious directory creation, with uninitialized name.
    - Fix Windows 2000 migration, by not trying to import music if not
      present.
    - Fix detection of Windows-NT-like registry path in ma-search-users, by
      splitting and reusing WINNT code from utils.c
    - Reimplement copy using read/write (like cp) to handle large files,
      since we can't mmap() (twice) large files in memory.
    - fix segfault by zeroing buffers for strcat.
    - Improve WINNT patch to factorize user registry location as well.
    - Vista profile directories support.  Get profiles directory from
      registry for ma-search-items and ma-import as well ("Documents and
      Settings" is not correct in Vista), this also allows us to read the
      user registries.
    - Vista users support.  Filter Public and Default users for Vista (from
      registry keys).  Filter "Default User" key in Vista (it is a junction
      to Default).  Do not segfault if keys are missing.
  * More efficient and less error-prone device substring extraction.
  * Set the locale to C when using expr.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * In the Windows case in mount_os:
    - Look in /proc/mounts, not /proc/partitions.
    - Look in /proc/mounts before /etc/mtab.
    - Make sure to select only the first mountpoint for a given device (in
      case of bind mounts).
