    - Set default hostname to 'ubuntu'.
    - Set priority for get_domain to high for static configurations.
    - Set priority for get_domain to medium for non-static configurations.
    - Use 'auto <interface>' for all interfaces, dropping allow-hotplug
      which doesn't work with current udev.
    - Set DHCP and DHCPv6 timeout to 30s.
    - Use isc-dhcp-client-udeb on all architectures.
    - Flush all addresses and routes before configuring interfaces
      (LP: #848072)
    - Don't copy /etc/resolv.conf to target if resolvconf is installed.
      (We already write resolvconf configuration to /etc/network/interfaces.)
    - Add a post-base-install hook to detect resolvconf and copy
      /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf to outside the target so that when /run
      is bind-mounted DNS resolving continues to work. (LP: #926447)
    - Apply patch from Alec Warner making netcfg respect netcfg/dhcpv6_timeout
      and running dhclient in one-shot mode (-1). (LP: #917905)
    - Fix FTBFS by checking the return value of fgets and fscanf.
    - Fix nm-conf to generate a valid NetworkManager static configuration file.

  * Stop mentioning FireWire in generic description for ethX devices, to avoid
    confusing users. ;-)
    I think this is ok to drop as since hw-detect 1.47, devnames should have
    descriptions for firewire devices. When #405421 was filed,
    sysfs-update-devnames had not been fixed to look in
    /sys/class/net/<foo>/device/bus and so firewire interfaces lacked special
    descriptions.

  * If there is no permanent IP address with which the system hostname
    (i.e., that which is returned by the "hostname" command) can be
    associated in /etc/hosts then associate it with address 127.0.1.1
    rather than 127.0.0.1.  Associating the system hostname with the
    latter had the unwanted effect of making 'localhost.localdomain'
    the canonical hostname associated with the system hostname.
    That is, 'hostname --fqdn' returned 'localhost.localdomain'.
    (Closes: #316099)
    Programs that access local services at the IP address obtained by
    resolving the system hostname SHOULD NOT DO THIS, but those that
    do so will not be disappointed: most services that listen locally
    listen on all 127/8 addresses, not just on 127.0.0.1.

    - Back up netcfg/choose_interface preseeded value, and if the question
      is not displayed to the user, restore that value, overriding the

      use the selected default interface anyway.
    - That should make interface preseeding work in all situations.

netcfg (0.71) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joshua Kwan
    - Remove XSIisms in dhclient-script.
    - Evaluate argv[0] after calling basename on it so that we can strcmp it
      against "ptom". It somehow didn't happen in the internal dhclient-script
      context, but appeared during testing in the shell.
    - Add Thomas Hood to Uploaders.
    - Re-enable broadcast stuff in dhclient-script, fixing a Sparc (at least)
      regression.
    - Remove kill_dhcp_client prototype from netcfg.h because it's now static.
    - Change newline + a space to just a newline to end some disable_dhcp
      woes.
    - Warn if there's no default route available after getting a DHCP lease.
      (Closes: #253543)
    - Don't add 'auto' or hotplug mapping lines for 16-bit PCMCIA devices.
      (Closes: #248071, #239284)
    - Add a missing fclose in iface_is_hotpluggable.
  * Christian Perrier
    - netcfg-dhcp.templates
      Some rewrite for being clearer, possibly. Run debconf-updatepo
  * Thomas Hood
    - Change interfaces options that use underscore to hyphens. No loss
      of functionality. (Closes: #255185)
    - *.c:
      + Test for NULL pointers before using empty_str()
    - netcfg.c, netcfg-dhcp.c, netcfg-static.c
      + Handle the case where there are no interfaces.  Just ask for a
        hostname and write basic /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/hosts
        files.  (Closes: #243543)
    - netcfg-common.c:
      + netcfg_get_interface(): Don't exit if there are no interfaces.
        Instead just return with variables set to 0.
      + netcfg_write_common(): write basic /etc/network/interfaces and
        /etc/hosts files even if the ipaddress is 0.
    - static.c:
      + Add resolvconf support (Closes: #255187)
      + Add comments to /e/n/i about which packages implement which options
    - dhcp.c
      + Add comments to /e/n/i about which packages implement which options
      + Fix race to dhcp_exit_status after dhcp_running set to 0.
      + Count iterations in the polling loop instead of checking the time()
      + Use waitpid(dhcp_pid,,) instead of wait() to get child status
        since we don't want the status of, e.g., killall.sh
      + Eliminate use of dhcp_running and use (dhcp_pid>0) in its place
      + Eliminate some unnecessary calls to kill_dhcp_client()
      + Mark local variables with "static"
      + Eliminate use of quit_after_hostname by creating HOSTNAME_SANS_NETWORK
        from HOSTNAME and DOMAIN_SANS_NETWORK from DOMAIN
      + Use DHCP hostname as the default hostname if no hostname is set
        (Closes: #239591)
      + Write hostname provided to the DHCP client in order to get a lease
        on the "hostname" option line for the interface in /e/n/i
      + If the user backs up from netcfg/get_hostname, go to retry question
      + Wait at least two seconds for DHCP client to exit  (Closes: #255984)
      + Clean up code
        . Always use spaces for indentation
        . Improve comments
        . Reorder state machine states
        . Move some functions around
    - netcfg-dhcp.templates:
      + More updates
      + Run debconf-updatepo again

netcfg (0.70) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Joshua Kwan
    - Brown paper bag upload.
    - Add the netcfg/disable_dhcp template, default to false.
    - usleep(1500) actually sleeps for 1500 _micro_seconds, not milliseconds.
      sleep(2) instead for simplicity.

  * Sylvain Ferriol
    - fix error message during plip config. (Closes: #253361)
  * Christian Perrier
    - Remove trailing exclamation mark from netcfg/dhcp_success_note
    - Run debconf-updatepo and unfuzzy templates for removed exclamation mark
  * Joshua Kwan
    - Corrected reference to the pppconfig package. (Closes: #253086)
    - killall.sh: add grep -v grep (Closes: #253099)
    - Allow netcfg/disable_dhcp option that governs what use_dhcp is
      set to every time we start, instead of hardcoding true. Defaults
      to true, so default behavior has not changed. (Closes: #248147)
    - Fix /etc/hosts writing after much deliberation. (Closes: #247734)
    - Use a static buffer for mii-diag call.
    - Sleep for 1.5 seconds before mii-diag, because slow network cards
      just take that long to answer. And for those that take more that's
      just too bad.

netcfg (0.68) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Severity medium for the static configuration fix.
  * Joshua Kwan
    - When we get a hostname from DHCP, seed the domain name with whatever
      was received.
    - Rework is_hotpluggable_iface a tad.
    - Fix problem where broadcast address was being used twice.. only on
      some architectures, due to code with unspecified behavior.
    - Excise our dynamic prebaseconfig system and replace with a static one
      that copies all available files into /target.
    - For this, make sure we always start with a clean slate by removing
      those files at startup.
    - Move a bunch of static strings to the header file.

netcfg (0.67) unstable; urgency=high

  * The "we love bugfixes that make new bugs" release.
  * Per Olofsson
    - Fixed segfault in find_in_devnames when a card was missing a devnames
      entry.
  * Joshua Kwan
    - Add a NETCFG_VERSION thingy so it's easier to figure out who's using
      what.
    - Don't reset the hostname to 'debian' on a failed seed from DNS.
    - Write resolv.conf and nothing else before preliminary activation
      for static configuration. This fixes the overwriting of static-specific
      interface entries with the common (lo) entry.

    - Fix machine state in static configuration to call QUIT.
      (Closes: #250074)
    - Rewrite resolv.conf in static configuration once we acquire a
      domain name.
    - DHCP server is not required to supply a domain name. (Closes: #250021)
    - Switch to using mii-diag-udeb instead of mii-lite.c, which doesn't
      seem to work across the board. (also addresses #250074)
    - In static configuration, if the IP address specified turns out to be
      the same as what we suggest for the gateway, nuke the last part of
      the dotted quad because gateway == IP makes no sense. (Closes: #241490)
    - Turn off backup for error messages in static configuration.
    - Bake all of the getif* functions into one big char**-returning jelly
      roll, get_all_ifs().
  * Bastian Blank

netcfg (0.64) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Joshua Kwan
    - Split out all functions into static.c, dhcp.c, wireless.c.
    - Remove dep alternative to busybox-cvs-udeb etc., since udhcpc is no
      longer available in any initrd. This causes businesscard and netinst
      installs to fail because busybox is already provided and hence gets
      used.
    - Remove udhcpc support in dhcp.c.
    - Port wireless fixes back to netcfg-static and netcfg-dhcp, which
      have been rather neglected lately.
    - Fix the GO_BACK interaction between WEP and ESSID configuration.
    - Switch to using iproute for everything, a step towards removing
      ifconfig and route applets from busybox.
    - Add amd64 support. (Closes: #249363)
    - Open one set of socket FDs and use them for the whole runtime.
    - Write loopback all the time, even when you abort network config.
      (Closes: #248636)
    - Redesign DHCP strategy with a new template that uses a select,
      allowing the user to clearly alternate to static network config
      (Closes: #244901, #227722)
    - Display a brief note when DHCP lease gets acquired. (Closes: #247751)
    - Now we can ask for a DHCP hostname to add. (Closes: #236533, #239591)
    - If we didn't use one, see if the server is offering us one and seed
      netcfg/get_hostname with it. (Closes: #239121, #240701)
    - Failing that, bring the interface up and try to reverse-resolve
      the IP address into a hostname.
    - For idempotency reasons, down all interfaces after finding each
      one so that we can start from a clean slate. (Probably deals with
      Bug#227722)
    - Silently load af_packet. (Closes: #244441)
    - Add some code hunks from mii-diag to determine code path on link
      connection. (Closes: #247178)
    - Add some interface_up and interface_down functions.
    - Fix a long standing bug in devnames retrieval that did not strip
      newlines from the devnames input and caused cdebconf to screw
      up on subsequent questions.
    - Bump the DHCP wait to 15 seconds. The magic number seems to be just
      over 10 for me. (Closes: #244819)
    - Template cleanups: netcfg/static-title, netcfg/dhcp-title,
      netcfg/internal-pcmcia, netcfg/confirm_dhcp
    - Add dhcp3-client support. Not that it actually gets used now that
      we can get a DHCP-supplied hostname from dhcp-client.
    - Remove a lot of calls to /sbin/this and /sbin/that in response to Joey's
      rant on debian-boot.
  * Bastian Blank
    - Remove sleep.
