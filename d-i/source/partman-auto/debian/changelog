partman-auto (118ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Resynchronise with Debian.  Remaining changes:
    Recipe changes:
    - Adjust default partition and EFI sizes for Ubuntu.
    - Change the x86 atomic recipes to make the minimum swap size be 100% of
      RAM, so that hibernate always works.
    - In addition to EFI partition, reuse existing swap partitions and
      BIOS Boot Partitions, if any, rather than creating new ones.

    Automatic Partitioning:
    - Offer resize_use_free autopartitioning method, except on armel/armhf.
    - Add an option to reuse an existing installation.
    - Split out the replace option from resize_use_free.

    Code changes:
    - Accept autopartitioning automatically rather than showing
      choose_partition.
    - Drop priority of partman-auto/choose_recipe question to medium.
    - Add support for partman-auto/method=loop via partman-auto-loop.
    - Make biggest_free respect the selection made in partman-auto/disk.
    - Exclude devices containing the installation medium from automatic
      partitioning.
    - Use new get_real_resize_range function from partman-partitioning
      72ubuntu3, which caches calls to tune2fs and ntfsresize.
    - Support resizing the largest partition on multiple disks.
    - Support formatting the entire partition for any partition that can be
      resized.
    - Signal to clear_partitions in partman-target that it should not notify
      the user about the unformatted partitions we have set up.
    - Add a hack to stop EFI System Partitions showing up as to-be-formatted
      in the confirm-changes screen when there's an existing filesystem that
      would cause partman-efi to skip them.

  * Changes Debian merged from ubuntu:
    - EFI recipes, but not for kfreebsd and with larger system partition
      sizes. Kept our efi partition sizes, which closer match Windows/Mac
      EFI partition sizes.
    - $reusemethod was also merge, but used for EFI partitions only and
      not for swap & BIOS Boot Partitions.
    - Drop the bootable flag from i386/amd64 recipes.

  * Dropped changes:
    - "Add kfreebsd-i386/efi, and kfreebsd-amd64/efi symlinks to regular
      efi recipes." Ubuntu doesn't have kfreebsd port, and debian didn't
      take this change.

  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Adjust default partition sizes for Ubuntu.
    - Accept autopartitioning automatically rather than showing
      choose_partition.
    - Drop priority of partman-auto/choose_recipe question to medium.
    - Offer resize_use_free autopartitioning method.
    - Add support for partman-auto/method=loop via partman-auto-loop.
    - Drop the bootable flag from i386/amd64 recipes; it can break existing
      Windows installations when autopartitioning only free space rather
      than a whole disk.
    - Remove explicit $primary{ } specifiers from standard recipes. We only
      need them to be primary if no other primary partitions exist already.
    - Add relatime to all autopartitioning recipes.
    - Make biggest_free respect the selection made in partman-auto/disk.
    - Exit straight away if a called script is killed by a signal.
    - Add ext4 support.
    - Add support for $default_filesystem as the partition type in a recipe,
      and $default_filesystem{ } as an internal specifier.

  * recipes.sh: correct error handling for non-existant recipe description.
  * Increase minimum size of root partition in multi recipe. This is mainly
    needed in case there is no separate /boot partition, but also to allow
    for e.g. the /emul directory.
  * Use "-1" instead of "1000000000" to indicate unlimited partition size in
    partman recipes. This avoids an error when setting up LVM on disks larger
    than 1TB. See: #510544.

  * Use convert_to_megabytes() in decode_recipe(), autopartition and
    perform_recipe.
    Depends: partman-base (>= 125)
  * Rename $devfspv_devices to $pv_devices in lib/auto-shared.sh now that we
    don't have devfs devices anymore.
  * create_primary_partitions() and create_partitions() now add dm-crypt
    devices to $pv_devices when using the "crypto" method, like it is done for

    multiple disks at once.  autopartition has been updated accordingly.
    Breaks: partman-auto-lvm (<< 29)
  * Call autopartition-lvm on all disks in partman-auto/disk at once to enable

  * Use the size values for /boot from the generic recipe for iop32x
    and orion5x since there's no reason to divert from the default.
  * Allow LVM on iop32x and orion5x.
  * Add recipes for ixp4xx that allocate more swap than other recipes
    (for the Linksys NSLU2 which only has 32 MB RAM).
  * ixp4xx: Don't offer lvm by default since it uses many resources.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Change default file system for /boot partition from ext3 to ext2.
    As they are relatively small the journal overhead is fairly big and
    because the transaction volume is very low the need for a journal is
    a lot less than on other partitions.

    - auto.d/initial_auto: If partman-auto/method is preseeded and
      partman-auto/disk is not but there is only one disk, act as though
      partman-auto/disk had been preseeded to that disk. This simplifies a

  * choose_partition/auto/do_option: Improve ask_user exit code handling as
    follows: 255 is backup, so return to the choose_partition menu (rather
    than propagating 255 and thus backing up all the way to the d-i main
    menu); 100-254 means that an automatically_partition script attempted to
    skip the manual partitioner, assuming that it was running from the
    initial auto.d pass, but this doesn't make sense if the manual
    partitioner has already been displayed so we can treat this exactly the
    same as a backup. All other exit codes are handled (99: retry) or
    propagated (anything else) as before.

  * Also set free_type in wipe_disk as that is needed by the function
    create_primary_partitions. This allows partman-auto-lvm to actually create
    the /boot partition as a primary partition.
  * Allow to include definitions of partitions in regular recipes that should
    only be used for a certain type of auto partitioning. This is useful to
    allow e.g. a definition for a /boot partition to be included that is not
    to be used for regular auto partitioning, but is needed for auto-lvm.
    The actual implementation is in reverse as that seems more flexible: a
    partition can be marked using "$<type>ignore" (where <type> is default or
    lvm) and will then not be included. Multiple ignore marks are possible.
    To implement this, the functions choose_recipe and decode_recipe now take
    an extra argument indicating the type of autopartitioning being done.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Renamed multi_user scheme to just "multi" as in multiple partitions.
    There are more uses for this scheme than multi user systems.
  * Switch package to arch all and only include recipes for the given
    architecture and any subarches in each package.
  * Rules file cleanups.
  * Control file cleanups.
  * Change descriptions of home and multi recipes to just list the partitions
    that are included. Closes: #287409, #288884
  * Increase minimal size of / partition in home recipe to 500 mb.
    Closes: #289419, #330079
  * Double the weight of the root partition in the multi scheme from 400 to
    800. This should increase the size allocated on reasonable size disks
    from the previous 250 mb to something slightly more reasonable.
    Closes: #328514

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * Add a smalldisk recipe for alpha, so that systems with little disk space
    can use a single ext2 partition for the whole install (closes: #261182).

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Remove duplicated chrp_rs6k recipes and install a symlink instead.

  [ Fabio M. Di Nitto ]
  * Start implementing bits required to avoid code duplication with
    partman-auto-lvm as per discussion on debian-boot mailing list.
    (See http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2005/10/msg00842.html)
  * Add lvmok{ } to recipes as per discussion on debian-boot mailing list.
    NOTES:
      - nobody objected to a tag/properties/flag name or proposed something
        different. It is clearly ok to rename it if it doesn't fit.
      - swap will stay out of LVM for now. In some cases it is known to break
        suspend/resume. It seems not all kernels are able to resume from it.
      - porters will have to adjust their recipes. I could only test
        i386/amd64 (via recipes) and powerpc-powermac_newworld (via
        recipes-powerpc-powermac_newworld).
  * Move common code into auto-shared.sh shelllib and create 3 functions:
    wipe_disk, create_primary_partitions (see comments in the file) and
    create_partitions.
  * Install auto-shared.sh in /lib/partman (chages debian/rules)
  * Make perform_recipe and autopartition use auto-shared.sh.
  * Make create_partitions set a var for all the devices that will be marked
    as pv. This is actually only used by partman-auto-lvm, but it is generic
    enough that could be used later on for other tasks.
    NOTES: the above changes have been tested on i386/amd64/ppc and there is
    no known breakage. The code is only moved around and none of the actual
    recipes use method{ lvm } used by partman-auto-lvm to mark partitions as
    pv volumes.

  * If multiple disks are present, ask which disk the user wants to
    partition before moving on to autopartitioning, and make
    autopartitioning apply only to that disk. Since no autopartitioning
    choices apply to more than one disk at once anyway, this produces a
    better UI on multiple-disk systems.

  * Make sure to wipe disk label on sun disks before recreating a new one.

  libparted did grow a C/H/S sanity check in disk_sun.c. While this is a sane
  check to perform, parted_server doesn't understand the exception and fails
  because it gets a wrong size of the disk when writing a new label.
  Since we are in deep feature freeze, there is no time to make a proper fix
  into parted_server (that needs to be propagated all the way and back to
  the UI to handle it properly).

  Make sure to wipe the first 512 bytes of the device once the user confirm
  what really should be done so that libparted will initialize the label
  properly and everything will work as it should.
