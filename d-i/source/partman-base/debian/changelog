  * Merge from Ubuntu:
    - Disable backup while displaying device/partition locked errors; it
      makes no sense and it can cause us to exit without closing the FIFO to
      parted_server (closes: #505477, LP: #274219).
    - Add support for explicit 'b' or 'B' suffixes on partition sizes to
      force interpretation as bytes (closes: #322922).
    - Add a small test suite for longint2human and human2longint.
    - Exclude /dev/ramzswap devices (http://code.google.com/p/compcache/).
    - Add partman/early_command hook to run arbitrary commands immediately
      before partitioning (LP: #239348).
    - Exit straight away if a called script is killed by a signal.
    - Only mark the partition table as changed due to CHANGE_FILE_SYSTEM if
      it actually makes a change (i.e. the partition wasn't already using
      that filesystem or didn't have that flag set). This avoids the
      partition table being rewritten even if partman did nothing more than
      autousing swap (LP: #287660).
    - Add partman/default_filesystem template so that we can remove
      hardcoding of ext3 from elsewhere in partman, and make the default
      filesystem preseedable.
    - Check dmraid's exit code rather than parsing its output.
    - Don't display the Back button when asking for confirmation, since it's
      already a boolean "do you want to continue?" question and we ignore
      backup anyway (LP: #9244).
    - Cope with exception options, partition flags passed to SET_FLAGS, and
      the partition name passed to SET_NAME being empty (closes: #268495).
    - Use 'update-dev --settle' rather than 'update-dev' during commit.
      Requires di-utils 1.66.
  * Run 'depmod -a' after loading extra partman components, since they might
    install further kernel modules as dependencies.
  * Mark partman/exception_handler and partman/exception_handler_note unseen
    before asking them; they're effectively error messages but implemented
    using select and boolean templates, so won't necessarily be reshown
    otherwise, and failures may be very confusing if these aren't shown.

    not normally probe automatically, such as loop devices. (Read-only

    - Clarify partman/confirm to not imply that the partition table will
      always be overwritten.
    - Add explicit dependency on libparted1.6-udeb. The dependency generated
      from substvars won't work. The only reason we got libparted1.6-udeb
      before without this dependency was because of some long and fragile
      dependency chains involving other udebs that have now changed/broken.

    - Use substvars to get a usual libc6 dependency, libc6-udeb's provide will
      work with this since libd-i does not do version checking. libc-udeb,
      which was depended on, is no longer in unstable.
    - Provide created-fstab, moved here from partman-target.

    - Really exit 10 on backup from main partitioning menu. Closes: #242677

      Those which are supported use msdos labels.

      visible at startup.  Also partman-target provides a help item in
      the main menu.  Thanks to Martin Michlmayr (closes: #238381).  
    - two dividers -- before and below the partition table.
    - in the confirmation dialog say which partitions are going to be
      formatted.  Thanks to Sven Luther, Mario Girlando and Frans Pop 
      (closes: #237009, #238389, #239388).
    - templates: make partman/confirm_write_new_label translatable
    - parted_server.c: do not generate exceptions when creation of file
      system fails. 
    - definitions.sh: write separator in the log file.  This keeps track
      in the log file which scripts are being executed. 
    - definitions.sh (debconf_select): convert the first space in the
      options to non-break space as otherwise the default options is
      ignored if it starts with space.
    - visual.d/method: show the smileys for all methods, not only for keep

    - parted_server.c: new function named_partition_is_virtual

      system in virtual partitions
    - parted_server.c (command_resize_partition): return the right value
      of the end of the new partition geometry
    - parted_server.c (get_resize_range): do not take into account the
      file system in virtual partitions
    - add dependency on di-utils-mapdevfs
    - definitions.sh (human2longint): when no multiplier is given the
      default is megabytes.  Thanks to dan_at_watson.ibm.com, closes: #239561
    - rules: remove .svn directories from the package
    - show which partition we are editing in the active_partition
      menu. Thanks to Gaby Schilders, bilbrey_at_orbdesigns.com and
      Matthew Woodcraft, closes: #238712, #239430, #239445.
    - definitions.sh (menudir_default_choice): do not run the choice
      scripts in order to find the item-id.  Take the id as argument
      instead
    - parted_server.c (partition_info): parted returns wrong paths of the
      devices of the partitions in dvh (SGI) disk labels.  Correct them.
      Thanks to Thiemo Seufer, Nicholas Breen and Maitland Bottoms, 
      closes: #220990, #238363, #239648.
    - do not provide partitioned-harddrives on mips (parted recognises but
      can not edit properly dvh disk labels
    - change the main-menu number of partman on mips from 49 to 44: use
      partitioner to partition harddrives but partman instead of partconf
    - definitions.sh (partition_tree_choices): shorten the indent of the
      partitions; visual.d/name: change the width of the name from 14->12.
      These changes are because dvh disk labels have both primary/logical
      partitions and partition names so the space is not enough for the
      mount point.
    - parted_server.c: fix segmentation fault when resizing partition with
      no file system
    - do not remove /var/lib/partman at startup, make directories with
      predictable names in $DEVICES.  Thanks to Brad Schick, closes: #240145

    - creation of new label should ignore the non-zero codes returned by
      storage_device/label/do_option. 
    - visual.d/filesystem: show the unusable free spaces as "unusable"
      instead of "FREE SPACE".  Most of the partition table types do not
      have extended and logical partitions and there was no indication in
      the main menu when some free space is unusable.
    - move the confirmation dialog for the creation of new label from here
      to partman-partitioning.
    - for s390, make partman not to be default partitioner, as it does not
      handle ibm disk labels.
    - for m68k, do the same since partman is quiet slow here and doesn't
      support the atari subarch.

    - I observed that the type of the partition is not translatable.  So I
      added four new templates - "primary", "logical", "pri/log" and
      "unusable".  Sorry, translators - without the new templates
      these strings would be left untranslated anyway.
    - a necessary change for SPARCs.  Because of bug/limitation in the
      implementation of the Sun disk labels in libparted they must be
      written to the disk before any consequent edition.  Because of that
      a new template had to be added (it is going to be used only on SPARCs). 
    - these changes are still not used by the other code of partman.
  * Joey Hess
    - Parameterise the menu-item-number.
    - For arm, make partman not be the default partitioner, as it does not
      handle 4 partitioning schemes used by arm subarches.
    - For mips, do the same, since parted does not know about dvh
      partitioning. Also because it's kinda slow (15 minutes on a fast indy).
    - Minor polishing of the new template.

    - definitiions.sh, parted_server.c: use third fifo file (stopfifo) in
      order not to rely on suppositions how libc works during
      synchronisation.
    - new file: init.d/dump.  It saves complete information about the
      partition tables in the log file of partman
    - don't show the menu storage_device.  Instead show a boolean question
      asking the users if they want to create a new, empty partition table
      on the selected disk.  Closes: #235365.
  * Joey Hess
    - Changed the menu item text again, removing the "(partman)".
    - Unfuzzy all translations.
    - Make ask_user use a default_choice file (insteas of last_choice).
    - Add a menudir_default_choice function which sets the default_choice of a
      menudir to the output of the given menu items's choices script.
    - Make debconf_select only set the default if a default is passed into
      it, to allow for database preseeding.
    - Stop using non-breaking spaces, using new space escape code in
      recent cdebconf. Fixes display on non-framebuffer terminal.
      (Anton Zinoviev: I reenabled non-breaking spaces as I can not use
      escaped spaces.  Properly setup non-framebuffer terminal must be
      able to display non-break spaces.)
    - Enhance confirm_new_label template text.

    - new release
  * Joey Hess

      choose_partition
    - added a confirmation message on partman exit to make sure the user does
      not accidentially destroy his data
    - shorten title to work around cdebconf bug

    - change menu item number to 42 so it's the default partitioner 
      (should this only be on i386?)

partman (11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Anton Zinoviev
    - in the menu for a storage device added new item to cancel the menu
      (for debconf frontends without back button)
    - sort the storage devices so that for example the devices on the
      second IDE channel are not listed before the devices on the first
      IDE channel
    - in the main menu: swap finish and undo.  Changed the text of finish
      and abort
    - renumbered init.d/update_partitions (90->70),
      init.d/filesystems_detected (91->71) and active_partition/finish
      (99->75) 
    - deactivated active_partition/chs (put "exit 0" in choices script)
    - fixed bug in update.d/visual causing only the first word of the
      partition name to be shown in the main menu
    - visual.d/filesystem uses template partman/filesystem_short/... as
      said in the new version of the documentation.
    - definitions.sh (error_handler): added support for new undocumented
      exception type 'No Implementation'
    - definitions.sh (error_handler): use partman/exception_handler_note
      instead of partman/exception_handler when there is only one one
      alternative
    - parted_server.c (command_get_resize_range): add
      deactivate_exception_handler
    - parted_server.c (resize_partition): add check for the case when
      there is a file system but it can not be opened
    - debian/templates: state that `partition the storage devices' is an
      alternative partitioner rather than additional partitioning step in
      the installer process

partman (10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Anton Zinoviev
    - Partman doesn't rely any more on partconf-mkfstab to convert devfs
      devices to normal devices.  A new command map_devfs does this using
      directly libdebian-installer.  
    - Add dependency on libdebian-installer4-udeb and build-dependency on
      libdebian-installer4-dev.
    - Use 32 instead of 40 as number for update-dev in commit.d to make
      the room between update-dev and the next script larger.
    - Use 20 instead of 90 as number for remove_backup in commit.d.
      Otherwise `undo' can restore invalid partition scheme.
    - Removed probably unnecessary loop in the abort function of /bin/partman.

      before the partman/active_partition template.  Closes: #232489
