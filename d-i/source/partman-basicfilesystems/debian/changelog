partman-basicfilesystems (84ubuntu1) saucy; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian.  Remaining changes:
    - If partman/automount is preseeded to true, automatically mount
      partitions with usefully-mountable filesystems on subdirectories of
      /media.
    - Add minimal support for NTFS partitions using ntfs-3g.
    - Mount FAT filesystems at boot (fstab pass 1).
    - Mount FAT (other than EFI System Partitions) and NTFS with
      umask=007,gid=46 (static group plugdev).
    - When formatting over the top of an existing swap partition, preserve
      its UUID to avoid leaving systems that use UUIDs in /etc/fstab without
      swap.
    - mount.d/basic: Close mount's fd 3 so that it doesn't inherit a debconf
      file descriptor, to prevent log-output hanging when ntfs-3g is in use.
    - Special case loopmounted filesystems as it's safer to format the
      underlying file, not the device.
    - Allow armel/omap to use FAT for /boot, since the problems with it can
      be worked around while it's difficult to use anything else given uboot
      limitations.
    - Stop using libparted to format swap partitions.
    - Disable existing swap partitions before formatting them.
    - Use mkdosfs to create FAT filesystems, since libparted cannot handle
      doing that on non-512-sector disks.
    - Always use mkfs.ext2 to create ext2 filesystems, since libparted's
      ext2 code is deprecated and can't handle large sector sizes.

    - new script select_mountpoint in order to share code with the other
      file system packages.
    - select_mountpoint: show descriptions of the directories.  Add /opt
      and /srv.  Thanks to Ryan Underwood, closes: #265296.
    - new scripts get_mountoptions and select_mountoptions in order to
      share code with the other file system packages
    - get_mountoptions, select_mountoptions: use a directory "options"
      instead of files "mountoptions" and "full_mountoptions".  Ignore
      options that are not allowed for the selected file system.  For
      example if the user chooses "notail" with reiserfs and then changes
      reiserfs to ext2 the option "notail" will be ignored
    - use capital letter in the long name of the file system ("Ext2 file
      system") to be consistent with the names of the other file systems.
      Thanks to Changwoo Ryu.
    - allow user to specify usage type (the -T parameter of mkfs.ext2) and
      percentage reserved blocks for super-user (the -m parameter of
      tune2fs).  The same change is made in partman-ext3.  Thanks to Tomas

partman-basicfilesystems (13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Don't call ext2 "extended 2". Closes: #235369
    - Add myself to uploaders.
  * Anton Zinoviev
    - finish.d/check_basicfilesystems: use name_progress_bar instead of
      the non-existing current_action
    - Do not use the generic template for checking file systems when
      checking swap space.  Add new template for this purpose.
    - Similarly, do not use the generic template for creating file systems
      when formatting swap space.
    - Do not create empty files mountoptions in partition directories.
      Otherwise the setting "defaults"  disappears in active_partition
      menu. 
    - Move the mount options definitions in the select list after option
      names.  Remove the long description screen.  Closes: #235370.
    - init.d/autouse_swap: the swap spaces are automatically selected for
      use only once.
    - check_basicfilesytems: add forgotten command db_get
