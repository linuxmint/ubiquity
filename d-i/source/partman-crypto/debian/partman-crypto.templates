 one-way hash function to it. Normally, there is no reason to change
 this from the recommended default and doing so in the wrong way
 can reduce the encryption strength.

_Description: Write the changes to disk and configure encrypted volumes?
 Before encrypted volumes can be configured, the current

 are allowed. Please decide if you are satisfied with the current

Template: partman-crypto/unsafe_swap
Type: error

_Description: Unsafe swap space detected
 An unsafe swap space has been detected.
 .
 This is a fatal error since sensitive data could be written out to
 disk unencrypted. This would allow someone with access to the disk to
 recover parts of the encryption key or passphrase.
 .
 Please disable the swap space (e.g. by running swapoff) or configure
 an encrypted swap space and then run setup of encrypted volumes again.
 This program will now abort.

Template: partman-crypto/passphrase
Type: password
# :sl3:
_Description: Encryption passphrase:
 You need to choose a passphrase to encrypt ${DEVICE}.
 .
 The overall strength of the encryption depends strongly on this
 passphrase, so you should take care to choose a passphrase that is
 not easy to guess. It should not be a word or sentence found in
 dictionaries, or a phrase that could be easily associated with you.
 .
 A good passphrase will contain a mixture of letters, numbers and
 punctuation. Passphrases are recommended to have a length of 20 or
 more characters.
 .
 There is no way to recover this passphrase if you lose it. To avoid
 losing data, you should normally write down the passphrase and keep it
 in a safe place separate from this computer.

 You entered a passphrase that consists of less than ${MINIMUM} characters,
 which is considered too weak. You should choose a stronger passphrase.

Template: partman-crypto/crypto_root_needs_boot
Type: error
# :sl3:
_Description: Encryption configuration failure
 You have selected the root file system to be stored on an encrypted
 partition. This feature requires a separate /boot partition on which
 the kernel and initrd can be stored.
 .
 You should go back and setup a /boot partition.

Template: partman-crypto/crypto_boot_not_possible
Type: error
# :sl3:
_Description: Encryption configuration failure
 You have selected the /boot file system to be stored on an encrypted
 partition. This is not possible because the boot loader would be unable to
 load the kernel and initrd. Continuing now would result
 in an installation that cannot be used.
 .
 You should go back and choose a non-encrypted partition for the /boot
 file system.

Type: boolean
Default: false
# :sl3:
_Description: Are you sure you want to use a random key?
 You have chosen a random key type for ${DEVICE} but requested the
 partitioner to create a file system on it.
 .
 Using a random key type means that the partition data is going to
 be destroyed upon each reboot. This should only be used for
 swap partitions.
