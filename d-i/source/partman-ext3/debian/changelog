partman-ext3 (79ubuntu1) saucy; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian (LP: #978032).  Remaining changes:
    - Special case loopmounted filesystems as it's safer to format the
      underlying file, not the device.
    - Add preseedable partman-ext3/lazy_itable_init question, which if true
      runs mkfs.ext* with '-E lazy_itable_init', greatly speeding up mkfs on
      large drives.  This defaults to false since it is currently unsafe for
      use on areas of disk that previously contained a filesystem.
