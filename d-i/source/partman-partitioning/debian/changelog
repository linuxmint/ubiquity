  * Upgrade to debhelper v7.
  * Convert BIOS GRUB boot area support to a method, thereby making it
    impossible to accidentally put a filesystem on such a partition as well,
    and making it simpler to preseed. See #491376. Thanks to Otavio Salvador
    for reviewing this.
  * Make partman-partitioning/bad_new_size,
    partman-partitioning/big_new_size, and
    partman-partitioning/small_new_size templates less terse (thanks, Evan

  * Use new function library ./lib/commit.sh. Requires partman-base (>= 115).
  * resize.sh: call device_cleanup_partitions() to ensure we remove obsolete

  * Moved definitions.sh to ./lib/base.sh.
  * Move resize.sh to ./lib/resize.sh.
  * Reorganization of partition label related code:
    - add new function library ./lib/disk-label.sh to include the function
      default_disk_label (previously in definitions.sh) and a new function
      create_new_label (factored out from storage_device/label/do_option)
    - add init.d/unsupported previously in partman-base
    - add partman/*_label templates previously in partman-base
    Part of this change was originally suggested by Jérémy Bobbio.
  * disk-label.sh: allow not to prompt for new disk label if default is valid
    (for use during guided partitioning).
  * disk-label.sh: remove existing LVM data from the device before creating a
    new disk label; this is now also done if a new disk label is created
    during manual partitioning.
  * Requires partman-base (>= 114); partman-lvm (>= 57).

  * Quote $(FS_DEPENDS) in dh_gencontrol arguments to avoid gotcha when
    adding extra items to it.

  * Make sure to wipe disk label on sun disks before recreating a new one.

  libparted did grow a C/H/S sanity check in disk_sun.c. While this is a sane
  check to perform, parted_server doesn't understand the exception and fails
  because it gets a wrong size of the disk when writing a new label.
  Since we are in deep feature freeze, there is no time to make a proper fix
  into parted_server (that needs to be propagated all the way and back to
  the UI to handle it properly).

  Make sure to wipe the first 512 bytes of the device once the user confirm
  what really should be done so that libparted will initialize the label
  properly and everything will work as it should.

  * Since most users seem to find it hard to figure out that you select the
    current size of a partition to change the size (*sigh*), make it explicit:
    Name the menu item for resizing "Resize the partition" and include the
    current size in parens.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Use 'rm -f' rather than more awkward test-then-remove constructions.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Use gpt instead of msdos disklabel for disks larger than 2TB.

      the user for confirmation.  Closes: #237400.
