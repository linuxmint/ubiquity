  * Rather than pretending that partitions have no longer been formatted
    after the partitioner is complete, reset their intended state from
    "format the partition" to "keep and use the existing data". This still
    solves the original problem reported in Debian bug #256090 while also
    stopping partitions from being needlessly reformatted if you go back to
    the partitioner after base system installation and then forward again
    (LP: #29712).
  * Don't clear partitions or complain about them not being formatted if
    they've already been formatted by a previous partitioner run.
  * Introduce partman/mount_style (choices: traditional, label, uuid) to
    allow controlling how filesystems are mounted. Default this to uuid, and
    stop using labels by default since they have unavoidable problems with
    removable disks (LP: #347817).

  * /media must be on the root file system (although subdirectories may be
    mounted separately), since the installer relies on being able to mount
    things like /media/cdrom during installation. Check this (LP: #16871).
  * Expand comment above each UUID-mounted partition, based on a suggestion
    by Daniel Pocock in Debian #509378.
  * Add a note about 'vol_id --uuid' to the top of /etc/fstab; thanks to
    Chris Cheney for the suggestion (LP: #221474).

    - Disable automatic mounting of USB removable devices.
    - Don't use UUIDs in fstab for those device types that volumeid.postinst
      refuses to convert.
    - Mount CD-ROMs and floppies with 'exec'.
    - Use the path of the file associated with a loop device in /etc/fstab,
      rather than the filesystem's UUID or the loop device path.
    - Always set the loop option for loop devices.
    - Remove critical system files from the existing filesystem before

    - Preserve the UID and GID of the initial user, if possible.  Requires a

    - Add currently available usb storage devices to the fstab.
      It is unfortunatly too hard (and probably not wise) to do anything
      if usb is available but no usb storage is plugged in. This will at
      least do reasonable things when installing from usb, or on systems
      with integrated usb storage.
    - Even if there is only one removable device in a class right now, there
      may be more later. So always use the numbered mount points scheme with
      the symlink.
    - Make a /cdrom link to media/cdrom, instead of adding a duplicate fstab
      entry for the device. Closes: #245898
