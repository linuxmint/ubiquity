  * Point users to blkid instead of non-existing vol_id (on the
    installed system) in /etc/fstab file header
    Closes: #608996

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * On kFreeBSD, mount does not follow symlinks in the mountpoint, so
    the way mount points were set up for removable media caused problems.
    So on that OS only, rather than making /media/cdrom -> /media/cdrom0,
    and putting /media/cdrom0 in /etc/fstab, instead make /media/cdrom
    a directory, and put /media/cdrom in /etc/fstab. This way¸ 
    "mount /media/cdrom", "mount /media/usb" etc all work, and so does
    apt-cdrom add.  Closes: #611569
    (Note that additional CD devices will be set up as /media/cdrom1, etc,
    same as before. This leads to the minor inconsistency on kFreeBSD that
    "mount /media/cdrom1" is needed for the second CD, while
    "mount /media/cdrom0" won't work for the first, but I don't
    see a way to avoid that.)

  * Resynchronise with Debian, largely to pick up checks for directories
    that must be on the root file system (LP: #148331). Remaining changes:
    - Use UUID= fstab syntax for all partitions if a UUID is available, and
      add a comment above each UUID to indicate the corresponding device at
      install time.
    - Disable automatic mounting of USB removable devices.
    - Don't use UUIDs in fstab for those device types that volumeid.postinst
      refuses to convert.
    - Mount CD-ROMs and floppies with 'exec'.
    - Use the path of the file associated with a loop device in /etc/fstab,
      rather than the filesystem's UUID or the loop device path.
    - Always set the loop option for loop devices.
    - Remove critical system files from the existing filesystem before
      installing.
    - Preserve the UID and GID of the initial user, if possible.  Requires a
      patch to user-setup.
    - Mount CD-ROMs and floppies with the "utf8" option by default.
  * Don't clear partitions marked "do not use" (LP: #198106).

    - Add currently available usb storage devices to the fstab.
      It is unfortunatly too hard (and probably not wise) to do anything
      if usb is available but no usb storage is plugged in. This will at
      least do reasonable things when installing from usb, or on systems
      with integrated usb storage.
    - Even if there is only one removable device in a class right now, there
      may be more later. So always use the numbered mount points scheme with
      the symlink.
    - Make a /cdrom link to media/cdrom, instead of adding a duplicate fstab
      entry for the device. Closes: #245898
