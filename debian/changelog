    - Added an advanced features dialog to the partitioning page. LVM, LVM
      with encryption and experimental ZFS support have been moved to this
      dialog.
    - Fix tag name from org.zsys to com.ubuntu.zsys.
    - Use version 5000 for bpool with some features disabled to stay
      compatible with grub and prevent users from upgrading and breaking their
      systems.
    - The partman confirmation dialog now displays the final layout of the
      partition that will be created instead of the true but confusing message
      from partman telling that an ext4 partition will be created (LP: #1847719)
    - Calculate the size of bpool to be 500M < 5% partition size < 2G
    - Always create an ESP and moved grub to the ESP.
    - Updated translation templates.

    Shell now launches gsd-xsettings itself, via the systemd units provided in
    `gnome-session` and `gnome-settings-daemon-common`. This conflicts with
    what we're doing in ubiquity-dm in two ways:
      - We are trying to launch gsd-xsettings ourselves, and you can only have
        one of these running at a time.
      - The user systemd environment does not have $DISPLAY in it, meaning
        that gsd-xsettings can't connect to the X server.
    Stop launching gsd-xsettings from ubiquity-dm, letting the shell handle it
    directly, and also export $DISPLAY into the D-Bus and systemd environments
    so that it can start up. (LP: #1844509)
  * ubiquity-dm: Don't launch ibus when we're running gnome-shell. These days
    gnome-shell takes care of running it itself.

  * Automatic update of included source packages: user-setup

    With the switch to GNOME Shell, we're no longer using GNOME Screensaver
    to handle blanking the screen. Setting the `idle-delay' to 0 disables
    this for Shell.
  * gtk, kde: Don't allow going back once we are anywhere past partitioning.
    The effect of this is that proceeding backwards from usersetup to
    timezone is not permitted any more. This is a harmful thing to be able
    to do because the timezone step 'resets' debconf after it finishes, and
    this might break an ongoing installation.

    What we need to do is wait until both timezone selection *and*
    partman_commit have finished before.
    This is a little bit delicate, because the user setup page, which comes
    after the timezone page, writes to debconf and so we have to be careful
    not to restart it after the user setup page is shown. We do that after
    finishing timezone selection, since this writes to debconf. It is not
    needed after partman_commit, because it only reads. (LP: #1798005)

  * Revert the previous upload. It didn't actually *fix* all cases, just
    papered over them. If the race was lost, the screen reader still didn't
    work in ubiquity-dm mode.
  * Move the Gio.Settings code into the constructor of the wizard. This runs
    with dropped privileges (uid = 0, euid = 999) whereas run() runs as root
    (uid = 0, euid = 0). When run as 0 / 0, dconf creates its
    XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/dconf/user database as root. We need to ensure that it
    runs in a context with dropped privileges. (LP: #1767067)

ubiquity (2.21.32) wily; urgency=medium

  * Resolve a spacing issue in the KDE ui.
    - Move vertial spacer for branding logo from designer file to code
    - Adjust spacing policies of the lefthand pane to do what we need:
      + the header layout doesn't expand anymore
      + the steps layout expands horizontally and verticall and additionally
        enforces its sizeHint as minimum.
      + the unused footer layout no longer expands horizontally but sticks to
        its minimum
    - Push branding logo to smaller size
      + The logo is now packed into a layout where it is spaced from left and
        right to cause an undefined shrinking as per Qt's choice. This
        effectively reduces the sizes of the logo both in width and height (as
        height is bound to width). This in turn brings the overall size down
        enough to not cause size expansion beyond "resonable" measures.
        (Reasonable being just big enough to be good looking but small enough
         to not push down on the labels in the steps widget. Latter has an
         unknown cause, but when the logo is too big it starts pushing on the
         labels, disregarding the entire sizepolicy of all involved widgets.
         If the logo is small enough this doesn't happen which either may be
         because there is a hardcoded height somewhere or the joint minimal
         size of all steps' pages is heigh enough to allow for this to happen.
         This overall layout problem has been there for years and only became
         visible now because we have a somewhat heigh widget below the steps
         layout. Ultimately this issue is going to get resolved if/when
         ubiquity gets ported to QML which is substantially more suited to
         building UIs like this with right scaling.)

ubiquity (2.20.0) utopic; urgency=medium

  * Exclude free space from counts of deleted partitions.
  * There are far too many situations where we fail to accurately detect all
    the operating systems installed on the disk, and we must defend in depth
    against losing user data as a result of this.  This includes not
    misleading users into believing that an option will erase less than it
    in fact does.  Therefore, never describe the use_device autopartitioning
    mode in any way other than "Erase disk and install Linux Mint", and offer
    separate "Erase Linux Mint <version> and reinstall" and "Erase disk and
    install Linux Mint" options even if we believe that the disk only contains
    Linux Mint (LP: #1265192).
  * Always show a confirmation dialog before committing partitioning.  I've
    read considerably more reports of users having their data destroyed by
    some misunderstanding or other of the partitioner than I'm comfortable
    with; if a slightly ugly confirmation even when we think things are
    clear saves some people from that, then it's worth it, and it adds
    another layer of defence against bugs.

  * If the combination of language and location does not identify a
    supported combined locale, use a locale based on the language for
    translation-like locale categories and pick one based on the location
    for other locale categories (LP: #1094872).  There are still some

ubiquity (2.11.0) quantal; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Install oem-config-slideshow-ubuntu in a separate pass from
    oem-config-$frontend and ubiquity-frontend-$frontend, since it may be
    missing from images; and only do this for the GTK frontend in any case,
    since other frontends don't currently use the slideshow (LP: #987050).
  * Re-enable alpha warning for quantal.
  * Upgrade to debhelper 9 for improved handling of compiler flags.  Make
    sure that /usr/lib/girepository-1.0/ stays where it's supposed to be
    despite changes in the default libdir for multiarch.
  * Port to Python 3:
    - Use Python 3-style print functions.
    - Use "except Exception as e" syntax rather than the old-style "except
      Exception, e".
    - Use reduce from functools rather than relying on the builtin.
    - Use list comprehensions rather than filter or map.
    - Use open() rather than file().
    - Import configparser rather than ConfigParser if available.
    - Use input() rather than raw_input() when running under Python 3.
    - Use set comprehensions.
    - Import quote from urllib.parse rather than urllib if available.
    - Use new-style octal literals.
    - Use test.support rather than test.test_support if available.
    - Add --python2 and --python3 options to tests/run to force running the
      tests under Python 2 or 3 respectively.
    - Handle renaming of __builtin__ to builtins in Python 3.
    - Only pass unicode=1 to gettext.install in Python 2.
    - Port ubiquity.auto_update to python-apt 0.8 progress classes.
    - Use Python 3 names for itertools.izip and itertools.izip_longest if
      available.
    - Use helpers from the six module to deal with some bytes/unicode
      differences.
    - As a general rule, open subprocesses with universal_newlines=True when
      expecting to read text from them.  This has no effect on Python 2
      (aside from \r\n conversion and the like, which is mostly a no-op for
      us), but causes Python 3 to read str rather than bytes.  The
      exceptions at the moment are: debconf-copydb subprocesses, which
      return mixed-encoding data that needs to be handled specially; and
      when feeding the output of a subprocess to hashlib.
    - Use six.reraise rather than the three-argument form of raise.
    - Adjust test_filteredcommand for Python 3 text handling.
    - Fix test_ubi_partman.question_has_variables to handle templates files
      as binary data, since they're mixed-encoding.
    - Cope with assertItemsEqual/assertCountEqual naming difference between
      Python 2.7 and 3.2.
    - Rearrange ubiquity.i18n.get_translations to treat debconf-copydb
      output as binary data and do field-dependent decoding.
    - Adjust test_misc and test_upower to cope with file type changes in
      Python 3.
    - Use xml.etree.cElementTree instead of libxml2; it's faster, has a
      smaller footprint by virtue of being built into the standard library,
      arguably easier to read, and works with Python 3.
    - Fix a slew of file handle leaks, including making much more liberal
      use of context managers.
    - When creating a default username based on the user's full name, decode
      it back to a Unicode type after running it through the
      ascii_transliterate encoder.
    - Remove __pycache__ directories on clean.
    - Use 'from __future__ import unicode_literals' in tests requiring
      Unicode literals.
    - Cope with various builtins and dict methods returning iterators rather
      than lists in Python 3.
    - Use chr rather than unichr in Python 3.
    - Use six.string_types rather than types.StringTypes.
    - Pass a byte string to Gtk.CssProvider.load_from_data.
    - Replace all calls to unicode() with calls to six.text_type() or
      misc.utf8() as appropriate.
    - Use unicode_literals in ubiquity.keyboard_names.
    - Fix up ubiquity.filteredcommand.debug and its tests for Python 3.  In
      Python 3, we can write Unicode strings (i.e. str) directly to
      sys.stderr, and its defaults are such that the worst case is that they
      get backslash-encoded.  Arrange the tests to simulate this.
    - Simplify ubiquity.nm.decode_ssid using bytearray(), allowing it to
      work with Python 3 too.
    - Open .debs in binary mode when verifying their contents.
    - Decode text read from debconffilter subprocesses in Python 3.
    - Only encode preseeded values in Python 2.  Python 3's debconf module
      accepts Unicode strings directly.
    - Encode the second argument to struct.pack.
    - Fix byte array handling when generating /etc/iftab.
    - Fix a missing bit of python-apt 0.8 porting in ubiquity.install_misc.
    - Open /var/lib/dpkg/status in binary mode when compressing it.
    - Pass bytes rather than text to kdecore.ki18n.
    - Call sip.setapi("QVariant", 1) on KDE frontend startup, pending a more
      complete port to the new API.
    - Use boolean tests rather than isNull, to cope with getting ordinary
      Python strings rather than QStrings.
    - In Python 3, pass strings directly to Qt rather than creating
      QStrings.
    - (Build-)depend on python3-gi, since python3-gi-cairo doesn't depend on
      that and in any case we use it directly.
  * Add Burmese translations.
  * Remove obsolete uxlaunch handling, since it's no longer used and has
    been removed from the archive.
  * Avoid locking failures when clicking on the "update this installer" link
    more than once.
  * Move a bit more code into ubiquity.install_misc, including a new
    target_file helper method.
  * Remove unnecessary #! lines from non-executable files.

  [ Stéphane Graber ]
  * Spawn dconf-service from ubiquity-dm and drop all the dbus-launch calls.

    the host system, running dmidecode and udevadm.
  * Restore 'from ubiquity import gtkwidgets' to
    test_ubi_partman.TestPageGtk.setUp; importing custom widgets fails
    without this.
  * Avoid touching D-Bus in migrationassistant test.
  * Stop leaking locale changes from gtkui and migrationassistant tests into
    the rest of the test suite.
  * Disable tests that require grub-installer templates only on non-x86
    architectures.
  * Re-enable test_maybe_update_install on x86, and add the missing
    mock.patch calls that caused it to fail in clean build environments.
  * Update translations from Launchpad.

  * panel: Fix the gtk3 css code so that it actually applies and add
    another override for the .menuitem padding that was making the panel
    28px large instead of 24px. (LP: #960998)
  * Only allow for one orca instance at a time. (LP: #945133)
  * Fix crash in set_indicator_keymaps when reaching the fallback code
    of the keyboard layout guesser. Added a test for it. (LP: #961003)
  * Make sure all the widgets of the quit dialog are always visible.
    (LP: #960600)
  * Switch to a single install_size() function in misc called by ubi-prepare
    and by ubi-partman. Tweak the resize partition sizes to enforce the
    minimum partition size in resize mode too. (LP: #960628)
  * Change ubiquity's virtual terminal to calling 'busybox tail' instead of
    'tail' to workaround the inotify on overlayfs bug.
  * panel: Only show icons, not labels, fixing our current "corruption"
    problem where the keyboard layout gets associated with another entry.
    (LP: #960039)

    geometry management (LP: #961025).
  * Refactor ubiquity.misc.grub_default to make it testable, and add tests
    for it.
  * Make test_misc pass when run on its own.  Apparently
    GdkX11.x11_get_default_xdisplay() segfaults if Gtk hasn't been imported
    (or possibly something finer-grained); so import Gtk from
    misc.set_indicator_keymaps even though we don't actually use it
    directly.

    LANG to something reflecting the location and
    LANGUAGE/LC_MESSAGES/LC_CTYPE/LC_COLLATE to something reflecting the

ubiquity (2.8.2) oneiric; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Preserve ordering of disks returned by partman-auto rather than
    shuffling them based on dictionary ordering (LP: #770711).  This uses
    collections.OrderedDict, which requires Python >= 2.7.
  * Run only those parts of oem-config-prepare that require root access as
    root; in particular displaying confirmation dialogs is now done as the
    calling user, which avoids KDE confusion (LP: #856418).
  * Go back to killing update-apt-cache's process group, but this time make
    sure that it's in a separate process group and make more of an effort to
    ensure that it terminates (LP: #743359).
  * Update translations from Launchpad.

    - Fetch geoname data asynchronously (LP: #837217).
  * Always start oem-config with LANG=en_US.UTF-8; this doesn't affect
    translations since we use debconf for those, but forces Qt to use UTF-8

  * Fix backing up to the language page in the KDE frontend (LP: #557225).
  * Bring back the debconf translation for password_extra_label.  The
    KDE frontend still uses it (LP: #557192).
  * Fix a small typo that was preventing the duration string on the

  * Fix backing up past partitioning when manual partitioning was
    selected (LP: #557210).
  * Let the user know why we're starting a desktop session or rebooting
    when ubiquity in only mode crashes.  If in automatic mode, the
    default is to reboot.  Preseed ubiquity/reboot_on_failure to false
    to start a desktop session instead (LP: #558371).

  * Removed the alpha warning.  Welcome to Linux Mint 10.04 Beta 1.
  * Align labels to the top on the language page (LP: #532876).
  * The run method of GTK+ dialogs enters a nested main loop.  However,
    the user can click the quit button (which calls the quit dialog's
    run method) before the page is ready.  Once the page is actually ready,
    another main loop is entered, and thus if the user hits the quit button
    on the quit dialog at this point, nothing will happen.  Work around this
    by managing the state of the quit dialog in the frontend.

ubiquity (2.1.18) lucid; urgency=low

  * Preliminary version of a new greeter, accessible using the
    'maybe-ubiquity' boot option.  In this mode, ubiquity-dm displays a
    choice between "Try Linux Mint without installing" and "Install Linux Mint"
    after starting X, rather than needing to present that choice at the boot
    loader.  This is not ready for production use yet and (desperately!)
    needs artwork, but merging it here will make it easier to test.  Thanks
    to Cody Russell for the first version of the greeter code.
  * Thaw choose_partition choices on partman startup.
  * Always use use_as method to get method choices rather than going through
    slower partman scripts.  (We were already doing this in some fast
    paths.)
  * Always use default_mountpoint_choices method to get mountpoint choices
    rather than going through slower partman scripts.  (We were already
    doing this in some fast paths.)
  * Cache question types in each DebconfFilter instance, saving a debconf
    command during widget search for every component using type: or ERROR
    matching.
  * Install wrapper scripts to cache results of os-prober and
    linux-boot-prober.  The wrapper approach means that we capture calls to
    these scripts from shell as well as Python.
  * Cache question descriptions in partman plugin, since these are
    frequently fetched and there's no REGISTER funkiness going on in
    partman.
  * Avoid descending into partman/free_space just to find out whether it's
    possible to create a partition there.  We can get the same information
    by inspecting the data returned by PARTITIONS.
  * Install set-date-epoch program from clock-setup (>= 0.101).
  * PROGRESS INFO takes a template, not a string (and even if it took a
    string, debconf's command parsing wouldn't like passing just a space);
    adjust install plugin handling to fix debconf_ui (LP: #521362).
  * Switch to source format 3.0 (native) with bzip2 compression, saving a
    little over a megabyte.

    zh_TW (LP: #517621).
  * Fix crash on keyboard variant selection (LP: #512953).
  * Enable cancellation of NTP syncing.
  * Correct tuple syntax in copy_debconf, thereby fixing copying of
    console-setup's debconf questions.
  * Fix unmount of /target/dev harder; second and subsequent arguments to
    os.path.join need to not start with a slash.
  * Automatically fall back to vesa if normal X startup fails.  This is a
    reduced emulation of bullet-proof-X; using the standard implementation
    is currently tricky.
  * Add a couple of lintian overrides.
  * Explicitly build-depend on xkb-data-i18n.  We normally skip
    console-setup's build-dependencies when generating our own, but we need

  * Don't fail to run oem-config if oem-config/early_command isn't set.
  * Copy oem-config/early_command from the installation preseed onto the
    installed system.
  * Try to dynamically detect the number of columns we'll need for
    stepLanguageOnly.  When showing < 15 languages, this fixes the
    orientation to be in a single column on small displays.
  * If no plugins declare themselves as plugin_is_install (such as the
    case in oem-config mode), then assume the last one is the install plugin.
  * Allow pages that are declared plugin_is_install to process other steps
    in process_step in addition to the install behaviors.
  * Add a try/except guard around the fetch of oem-config/extra_packages.
  * Add oem-config/late-command for cleaning up any preparation that was

  * Copy all oem-config/* templates to the installed system.
  * Add an additional package (oem-config-remaster) to remaster an
    Linux Mint ISO with additional packages and oem-config preseed data.

  * Expose extra functions get and substitute to plugins via it's

  * Drop extraneous handlers from Mythbuntu pages.
  * Move all handlers from mythbuntu_ui directly into plugins themselves.
  * Move some functions from the install.py script into a new file,
    install_misc.  The intention here is that they can then be used more
    directly by ubiquity plugins.
  * Add a new method for package removals to install_misc to allow
    plugins to mark packages to be removed later in remove_extras.
  * Modify the Mythbuntu services plugin to not even offer VNC if a short
    pw. (LP: #469312)
  * Convert most of the functions from mythbuntu_install.py into plugin
    type Install methods.
  * Support using pkgsel/install-language-support preseeded to false to
    ignore installation of language packs (just like alternates).
  * Drop mythbuntu_ui and all references to it.  The (former) Mythbuntu
    frontend is now fully pluggable into ubiquity's gtk_ui on it's own.
  * Fix unmount command in chroot_cleanup to actually release /target/dev.
  * In the KDE frontend for ubi-language, use findChildren to find widgets
    because QWidget itself is not iterable.
  * In the KDE frontend, don't try to set the text on the breadcrumbs early

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Add osextras.unlink_force, equivalent to 'rm -f', to save on tedious
    exception handling.
  * Only restart debconf-communicator when changing language, not every time
    we switch page.  This speeds up page transitions quite a bit, and should
    incidentally fix LP: #508725 as well.
  * GTK frontend:
    - Check plugin builders as well when adding widgets (setting their
      names, making them callable by the toplevel, etc.).  This fixes
      translations of the language, timezone, and keyboard pages.
  * Fix immediate retranslation when changing language.
  * Add a semaphore to misc.regain_privileges and misc.drop_privileges, so
    that a drop/regain pair always returns to the previous state.
    misc.drop_all_privileges is now more clearly one-way, enforced by an
    assertion.
  * Add a context manager (raised_privileges) and a function decorator
    (raise_privileges) that are equivalent to a
    regain_privileges/drop_privileges pair, but that wrap up the required
    try/finally logic to make it less likely that we'll end up at the wrong
    privilege level by mistake.
  * When attempting to upgrade the installer, only stop debconf-communicator
    once we've determined that we actually have something to upgrade
    (LP: #495175).
  * Require Python 2.6, for the 'with' statement.
  * Move default GRUB target calculation to ubiquity.misc, which is a better
    location for common code than ubiquity.components.summary.  Try to avoid
    using (hd0) as the target (prefer the first device from grub-mkdevicemap
    output if possible), and, when installing from a non-CD medium, only
    reset the default boot device if we would otherwise end up installing
    GRUB to the installation medium.
  * Initialise FilteredCommand.ui_loop_level earlier, just in case

ubiquity (2.1.1) lucid; urgency=low

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Run success_cmd, error_cmd, and automation_error_cmd as root.
  * Use /cdrom/casper/filesystem.size instead of calculating the size of
    /rofs on each run.
  * Include a progress message for ubiquity/success_command.
  * Do not use the preseeded install progress message as the install
    window title.  Use a more understandable string.
  * Check the syntax of any shell scripts in the source tree as part of
    debian/rules check.

  [ Mario Limonciello ]
  * When calling execute_root, don't pass a list because everything
    passed is translated into a tupple.  Passing a list causes subprocess to
    fail when invoked.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Add a button to the language page to upgrade the installer on the fly,
    based on work by Michael Vogt several years ago (LP: #55505).
  * GTK frontend:
    - Only set the debconf progress window's transience and type hint when
      it isn't already being shown.

ubiquity (2.1.0) lucid; urgency=low

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Run X with -nolisten tcp (LP: #462394).
  * Make sure we never try to install onto the live filesystem.
  * Only print the filenames being blacklisted if in debug mode.
  * Provide human readable sizes in the partitions-too-small warning
    (LP: #298974).
  * Mark the "Installation Complete" window as always on top
    (LP: #462178).
  * Fixes from Pychecker for the KDE frontend (kde_ui):
    - Don't import datetime or math.  The timezone code is in a separate
      module now.
    - Remove some unused variables.
    - Don't assign to a variable that's going to be immediately discarded.
  * Signal to GTK+ when using a right-to-left language, so that it
    composes the interface from right to left (LP: #222845).
  * Signal to the slideshow when the installer is using a right-to-left
    language (LP: #446989).
  * Set SUDO_UID and SUDO_GID in ubiquity-dm so ubiquity knows what user
    to drop privileges to (LP: #422254).
  * Do not try to configure networking in oem-config (LP: #471498).
  * Make migration-assistant import failures non-fatal to the overall
    install.
  * pkgsel now provides a debconf question to avoid warning the end user
    when the language packs could not be installed (LP: #471553).
  * Make sure a device exists as part of the grub target device
    validation.
  * Allow the user to retry grub installation with a different device on
    failure.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: apt-setup

    tzsetup 1:0.26ubuntu1, user-setup 1.28ubuntu1.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Add a debian/rules target to run pychecker. I've fixed several warnings,
    but there are still several left so this is not yet enabled by default.
  * Fix debconf frontend:
    - Start oem-config on stopping rc, as well as when starting display
      managers.
    - Add some missing imports (ubiquity.frontend.base.Controller,
      ubiquity.plugin.Plugin, ubiquity.i18n, signal,
      ubiquity.components.install).
    - If there's a containing debconf frontend, talk to it rather than using
      debconf-communicator.
    - Set a controller in the language plugin.
    - Use spaces rather than ${!TAB} in localechooser when using the debconf
      frontend, since debconf doesn't support the latter yet.
    - Don't handle user-setup preseeding for the debconf frontend.
    - Remove unused progress_position handling.
    - Fix exception names in ubi-network and ubi-tasks.
  * Require Python 2.5, so we can now use hashlib rather than md5 and avoid
    a slew of warnings.
  * Add an intro message noting that we're alpha again.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Run partman in the noninteractive frontend (otherwise we try to install

  * Explicitly print noninteractive output to the console (as the Python
    debconf module redirects sys.stdout to sys.stderr which ends up in
    /var/log/installer/debug).

ubiquity (2.0.4) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Do not install the live CD kernel in the target system when using
    PAE (LP: #413135).
  * Properly set the kernel version in the main install process when
    using PAE so that symlinks get created for the kernel and initramfs.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: partman-base
    133ubuntu4.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: grub-installer
    1.43ubuntu8, partman-basicmethods 43ubuntu1.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Change apport hook to prefer syslog, partman, and casper.log from
    /var/log/installer/ if they exist there, to support bug-filing after
    installation.
  * Don't set the "incomplete language support" note if only gimp-help-* is
    missing, since it's far too big to fit on CDs (LP: #452516).
  * Furthermore, always consider English as "complete enough". The packages
    that are missing from an installation from the Linux Mint desktop CD are not
    critical for a reasonable user experience.
  * Make use of check-language-support -a if pkgsel/language-packs is ALL,
    since that's orders of magnitude faster (LP: #458333).
  * Keep language-support-$LL installed if it happens to be in the live
    filesystem, since there's no point spending time removing it; but don't
    install it if it isn't in the live filesystem (LP: #458333).

ubiquity (2.0.3) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Use new check-language-support --show-installed option added in
    language-selector 0.4.16, so that we can arrange to keep language
    support packages installed that are already present in the live
    filesystem.

  [ Mario Limonciello ]
  * Pass the debug parameters to ubiquity even if running in noninteractive
    mode.
  * Don't provide the old init scripts, even under a temporary name anymore.
    - It appears that there is a race condition that can exist between when
      the upstart'ified version and the initscript version start that may cause
      only-ubiquity and automatic-ubiquity to (poorly) fail. (LP: #457858)
    - All login managers in use (gdm and kdm) have converted to upstart now.

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Calculate the amount of available memory in check-kernels (LP: #413135).
  * Automatic update of included source packages: grub-installer

ubiquity (2.0.1) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Check to see whether X crashed or ubiquity crashed before attempting
    to bail into the noninteractive frontend from only-ubiquity mode
    (LP: #444901).
  * Wrap the format warning label while working around GTK+ label layout
    problems (LP: #364617).

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Rewrite X_LOADTEMPLATEFILE commands in case they refer to template files
    in the /target chroot (LP: #452118).
  * Install -generic-pae kernels if necessary; this requires some custom
    hacks since -generic-pae isn't in the live filesystem (LP: #413135).
  * Don't do kernel installation/removal in oem-config.
  * Skip partition_too_small check during Wubi installs, as Wubi does some
    of its own checks and the delay imposed by this check looks particularly
    weird in Wubi. This may or may not be the cause of apparent hangs
    towards the end of partitioning, but I suspect that it will at least get
    rid of some conflated reports and make testing quicker.
  * Update translations from Launchpad.

ubiquity (2.0.0) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Bump to a stable version number series for Linux Mint 9.10.

    The main reason for the version bump was because we incorporated
    oem-config and needed to jump past its version numbers, but really
    Ubiquity 2.0.0 is quite different from Ubiquity 1.0.0 despite most of
    the changes being gradual and incremental. 3.5 years and nearly 5000
    lines of changelog entries later, we have several active developers,
    lots more translations, apport integration, a new partitioner,
    migration-assistant, automation, Mythbuntu and noninteractive frontends,
    Wubi, reinstallation without reformatting, a new timezone map,
    accessibility, many UI improvements, a slideshow, plugin support, and
    much more. Here's to version 3!

  * Install kernel headers to match the kernel (LP: #413135).
  * Recommend dmraid to ensure consistent behaviour across Linux Mint flavours
    (it was already present on the Linux Mint desktop CD, but e.g. not on
    Kubuntu).
  * If dmraid devices are active, then create
    /var/lib/disk-detect/activate_dmraid so that partman will exclude slave
    devices, and ensure that dmraid is installed in the target (LP: #90235).
  * Use check-language-support if available to select language support
    packages (LP: #434173).
  * Update translations from Launchpad.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: base-installer
    1.102ubuntu2, hw-detect 1.72ubuntu5.

  * ubi-intro.py: detect kubuntu-netbook-intro.txt if it exists and use

ubiquity (1.99.29) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Use a separate PROGRESS REGION for each install plugin (LP: #438979).
  * GTK frontend:
    - When switching language, translate other top-level widgets (dialogs)
      and their children, as well as the main notebook pages (LP: #441622).
  * Install a dummy initctl similar to the dummy start-stop-daemon while
    doing anything that might install or remove packages in the target
    system, so that attempts to control Upstart jobs won't do anything.
  * Stop Upstart jobs when switching to runlevel 0 or 6, which I think fixes
    repeated respawns on shutdown (LP: #432140).
  * Save /var/log/installer/debug to the target system if it exists.
  * In the auto-resize bar, use the preferred partition size requested by
    partman-auto/partman-partitioning, rather than hardcoding the maximum
    size or making up our own (LP: #421407).
  * Update imported translations from gtk+2.0 2.18.1-1ubuntu1 (adds Asturian
    and Bengali).
  * Update translations from Launchpad.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: apt-setup 1:0.41ubuntu2,
    console-setup 1.34ubuntu4, flash-kernel 2.13ubuntu12, grub-installer
    1.43ubuntu5, partman-partitioning 72ubuntu2, partman-target 64ubuntu2.

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Port fix for return_to_partitioning from the GTK+ frontend to the
    KDE frontend (LP: #439184).
  * Explicitly depend on reiserfsprogs so that we don't have to add it
    to every live seed (LP: #431976).
  * Write /cdrom/.disk/info to /var/log/installer/media-info
    (LP: #364649).

    as well as in /target (LP: #431786).

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Add missing definition of self.controller for the noninteractive

  * Use an explicit state file to determine whether oem-config runs, since
    with Upstart it's no longer straightforward to just add/remove rc*.d
    symlinks (LP: #432180).
  * We already avoid copy-blacklisting files in packages that have a prerm,
    since they might require non-trivial work before removing their files.
    Now also avoid copy-blacklisting files in dependencies of such packages,
    as otherwise we risk leaving programs in the target system for a while
    that don't have their library dependencies satisfied, causing confusion
    when other programs try to use them (LP: #436613).

    - Be more specific about packages that are removed in role selection.
      Unfortunately prior to this fix, choosing a Frontend role for example
      was not cleaning up mysql, apache, or mythtv-backend (completely
      defeating the purpose of a frontend role).

    self.userinterface list (LP: #361668).
  * Add support for displaying the "Use the largest continuous free space"

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Fix stripping of '=dev=' from device names when creating partition bars
    to avoid reducing e.g. '=dev=vda' to 'a' (LP: #362466).
  * KDE frontend:
    - Start the resize slider at the maximum possible size for the partition
      being resized; this is in line with the GTK frontend, and fixes the
      situation where the previous default (half-way between the minimum
      size and the current size) is out of range.
    - Use a better colour to represent the results of automatic partitioning
      (LP: #348461).
  * Preseed tzsetup/selected up-front rather than filtering it and then
    preseeding it; filtering it causes the backup state to be reset, which
    causes an infinite loop when backing up from the timezone page when the
    default country only has one timezone (LP: #361674).
  * Preseed passwd/auto-login-backup=oem in OEM mode, so that the original
    configuration files are available for restoration (LP: #361272).
  * Add a little extra state machine debugging to the partman component.
  * If an error/question dialog is displayed while changing steps is
    disabled, we currently need to re-enable changing steps in order to get
    a normal cursor, but that also enables the Back/Forward buttons and
    allows people to violate assertions by being too quick (e.g. selecting
    an autopartitioning choice while the installer is still busy analysing
    the possible choices). We should clean this up properly later, but for
    now just restore the allowed-change-step state when the dialog is
    finished.
  * Fix preseeding of the autopartitioning question to work in automatic
    mode: it needs to be preseeded as unseen, otherwise going back from a
    confirmation question doesn't work (LP: #361828). Remove an old code
    path that would have been very complicated to fix for this and is
    guaranteed to never be used nowadays.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * GTK frontend:
    - Copy-and-paste gdm-signal from powermanagement-interface, since that
      package is no longer in main and is slated to go away. In future we
      ought to be able to use gnome-session D-BUS calls or similar for this
      work (LP: #357101).
  * Use gksudo --preserve-env / sudo -E so that we can check DESKTOP_SESSION
    from the GTK frontend, and use other desktop environment variables in
    future.
  * Try a couple of different locations for NetworkManager's init script
    (LP: #356813).
  * Sync with console-setup 1.28ubuntu8: treat the Kazakhstan layout (kz) as
    non-Latin (LP: #356816).
  * Work around a debconf bug which broke the default time zone for some
    countries: REGISTER does not appear to give a newly-registered question
    the same default as the question associated with its template, unless we
    also RESET it, so do that (LP: #356794).
  * Update translations from Launchpad.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: base-installer
    1.98ubuntu6, console-setup 1.28ubuntu8, flash-kernel 2.13ubuntu6,
    partman-auto 84ubuntu3, partman-base 129ubuntu7, partman-target

  * Unset DEBCONF_REDIR in our apt-install shim so that starting up another
    debconf frontend will actually work, as needed when installing grub-pc.
    Also set APT_LISTCHANGES_FRONTEND=none just in case.
  * Install boot loader packages immediately rather than queueing them until

  * Silently skip non-existent devices in /proc/swaps (LP: #290947).
  * Use small print rather than italics in "Who are you?" (LP: #287626).
  * Revert r2984 from ubiquity 1.11.5, and instead filter out language packs
    that don't exist in the live filesystem's apt cache; this allows us to
    accurately produce incomplete language support notifications again.

  * Add a comment to partman/commit.d/01unmount_busy to explain why this
    script is still here despite similar code in partman-base.
  * Using "Yes" and "No" buttons for the weak-password question turns out to
    be more confusing than I'd hoped. Instead, use "Continue" and "Choose
    another password" (breaking the string freeze, but at least for only one
    string).
  * Suppress unnecessary exception if find_in_os_prober fails.
  * GTK frontend:
    - Don't bother calling find_in_os_prober for partitions without real
      devices (e.g. free space).
    - Fix spacing on timezone page (LP: #336745).
  * Fix handling of "yes" response to partman/unmount_active.
  * Display a warning on the advanced partitioning screen if the
    installation medium is mounted but not filling the whole disk, so that
    the disk containing it is still offered for partitioning (LP: #347916).
  * On armel, DEB_HOST_ARCH=armel but DEB_HOST_ARCH_CPU=arm. Check
    DEB_HOST_ARCH rather than DEB_HOST_ARCH_CPU.
  * Use the full size of the underlying images for the timezone map if the
    screen is big enough.
  * Install chroot-setup.sh and in-target from debian-installer-utils

  * Move bootloader dependencies to recommendations, to make it easier to
    cope with grub and grub-pc conflicting (LP: #353273).

ubiquity (1.12.0) jaunty; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Update for new message context system in GTK+ 2.15.1, and update
    imported translations from gtk+2.0 2.16.0-1ubuntu2.
  * Stop setting message attribute in InstallStepError; it isn't used and it
    generates a deprecation warning with Python 2.6. Similarly, rename
    PartedServerError's message attribute to parted_error.
  * Always set auto-login for OEM installations.
  * KDE frontend:
    - Hide auto-login and require-password radio buttons for OEM
      installations.
  * Remove reimplementation of gdm and kdm auto-login support for OEM
    installations, since user-setup handles this now and the duplication
    causes oem-config to be unable to undo autologin (LP: #347900).
  * Fix ubiquity/install_bootloader handling (LP: #348660):
    - Check the seen flag rather its value when deciding whether to override
      it with the UI's value.
    - Outside automatic mode, default the UI's "Install boot loader"
      question to the value of ubiquity/install_bootloader.
  * Offer "Yes" and "No" choices for user-setup/password-weak (LP: #349173).
  * Depend on grub | grub-pc, and don't remove grub-pc until after
    grub-installer has had the chance to decide whether it wants to use it
    (LP: #349835).
  * Add a compatibility wrapper for update-dev to ensure that it never
    attempts to call 'udevadm trigger', which isn't necessary in ubiquity
    and can cause problems (LP: #349937).
  * Permit dmraid-style /dev/mapper/* device names in advanced boot loader
    selector, as well as disk and partition numbers over 9 (LP: #342354).
  * Remove /target/var/lib/apt-xapian-index per Michael Vogt, since it needs
    to be rebuilt based on the installed system's sources.list, and apt's
    cron.daily script and/or synaptic will do this.
  * Preserve ordering of automatic partitioning choices when replacing them
    with our customised strings (LP: #351547).
  * Update translations from Launchpad.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: apt-setup 1:0.37ubuntu11,

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Make the partman/unmount_active dialog a yes or no question
    (LP: #346589).
  * Sort the list of regions on the timezone page (LP: #344334).
  * Merge Roman's city placement code into the GTK frontend.
  * Work in bytes rather than percentages in the partition bar code
    (LP: #336203).
  * Fix partition bar slider (for resizing) code by adding correct
    calculations for bounds checking and slider positioning.
  * Properly encode data from os-prober (LP: #345573).
  * Make sure that the before and after partitioning bars use the same
    colors for the same partitions (LP: #289324).
  * Fix the placement of the partition bars in scrolled windows when
    necessary.
  * Don't let the partition bars eat up any extra space.
  * Move selecting a disk from radio buttons to a drop down box on the
    automatic partitioning page.  This saves a lot of space when
    multiple disks are present and makes the code a little cleaner
    (LP 325958).

  * broken_packages is fairly slow due to having to iterate over the whole
    cache. Speed it up a bit by stopping when the number of broken packages
    found reaches cache._depcache.BrokenCount; this improves blacklist
    calculation time for the previously-mentioned DVD English-only install
    from 3:30 to 2:30 (see LP #335596).
  * GTK frontend:
    - Restore set_window_hints method for use by windows other than the main
      one (it was still called in the Glade file), just in case we're using
      a window manager that pays attention to this. In these cases

    adjustments for the shifted left edge and missing arctic region of the
    map.
  * Account for daylight savings when highlighting a region in the

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Stop the user-setup component from believing it's done after the user
    selects "go back" at a weak password dialog (LP: #340549).
  * Add ubiquity/keep-installed question which can be preseeded with a
    space-separated list of packages to keep installed even if they aren't
    in the desktop manifest and aren't in the list of language packs to keep
    (LP: #290400).
  * Expand dependencies of packages we know we want to keep (language packs,
    etc.) before calculating which packages to blacklist from file copying
    or to remove. This is more correct in the presence of Recommends of
    language packs, and furthermore saves considerable time when
    blacklisting. My test results for various language pack sets on a DVD:
    - en: 4:00 -> 3:30
    - de+en+es+fr+ja+ko+nb+nds+nl+nn+si+sk+sv: 5:30 -> 2:50
    - all: 14:37 -> 0:10 (!)
    This doesn't quite solve LP #335596 because testing a large number of
    packages for removal when there genuinely are lots of packages to remove
    is still quite slow, but it very significantly improves the worst cases.

      by user-setup, so use it there.
    - Eliminate mythbuntu_summary.py, and instead merge it into

    - wasn't deciding which language packs to use before generating the

    - was filtering out packages with prerms before doing ok-to-remove

    - needed to try recursively removing broken packages in order to get a
      fully-expanded list of reverse-dependencies out of apt;
    - was removing packages from the difference list too early so they
      stopped being considered as packages that were allowed to be removed.
    In an attempt to make this rather large change a little more reviewable,
    note that the code used to analyse removals while generating the

ubiquity (1.9.8) intrepid; urgency=low

  [ Mario Limonciello ]
  * Remove xmltv and dvbutils options, as they will be installed across
    all boxen now.
  * debian/control:
    - Drop depends for guidance on mythbuntu package.
  * Install custom mythbuntu recipe - only applicable for Mythbuntu
    frontend.
  * Add support for additional mythbuntu plugin, apple trailers.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * When copying files, remove regular files and symlinks if they exist
    already on the target; this can happen legitimately if installing over
    an existing system and /boot wasn't erased.
  * Make the Back button insensitive on the first page rather than hiding it
    (LP: #186953).
  * Rename main Cancel button to Quit, and adjust the quit dialog text
    slightly so that we consistently use "quit" as the action verb and
    "cancel" clearly means to cancel the dialog (LP: #45690).
  * Fix format string substitution error in _abstract method.
  * Allow skipping the unmounting of busy partitions by preseeding
    ubiquity/partman-skip-unmount to true (LP: #252667).
  * Automatic update of included source packages: debian-installer-utils
    1.59ubuntu2, grub-installer 1.32ubuntu2, partman-target 55ubuntu2.

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Also remove the langlevel file if it exists before we start
    localechooser.

ubiquity (1.9.7) intrepid; urgency=low

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Properly fix intltool dependency.  Remove old copies of intltool
    scripts.
  * Add an auto-login option to the "Who are you?" page.

  [ Michael Terry ]
  * Ensure that some widget is focused after changing page (LP: #241367).

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Add a no-op compatibility shim for depmod. Some d-i code calls it after
    calling anna-install in order to make sure that new kernel modules are
    installed properly; this is unnecessary and slow in the live CD
    environment (LP: #251117).
  * Brown-paper-bag bug: open /target/var/log/installer/oem-id for writing
    (LP: #251751).
  * Update summary page to fetch the language name correctly from the new
    localechooser.
  * Set SCIM_USER and SCIM_HOME to force scim to use configuration and
    sockets from the live CD user rather than root (LP: #234208).
  * Use a single private debconf-communicate instance for five queries in
    base frontend initialisation rather than using the debconf_operation
    wrapper. This is less convenient, but significantly speeds up startup
    (in a kvm instance here, 19 seconds -> 4 seconds).
  * Remove hardcoded invisible_char properties in order to use GTK's
    defaults (LP: #225882).
  * GTK frontend:
    - Don't translate step_label when switching to the language page;
      on_language_treeview_selection_changed will take care of it if
      necessary, and the page-switch handler may not know the correct
      language (LP: #225876).
    - Bind the Delete key on the partition list to "Delete partition"
      (LP: #218936).
  * KDE frontend:
    - Make "Details" string on summary page translatable (LP: #190491).
  * Depend on rdate for clock-setup.

    clock-setup 0.96ubuntu1, localechooser 2.03ubuntu2, user-setup

    - Fix crash when entering a non-ASCII mount point (LP: #128554).
  * Preseed netcfg/dhcp_ntp_servers from install component rather than
    clock-setup, since the latter doesn't have debconf database access at
    the right time (LP: #251089).

  [ Jonathan Riddell ]
  * language.py: Change string to unicode, fixes crash when using KDE
    frontend, closes LP: #251097
  * KDE frontend
   - comment out dcop code
   - add set_hostname method
   - temporarily force sudo until we work out why kdesudo stops it passing

  * Silence deprecation warning in zoommap.
  * Add ubiquity-dm implementation for matchbox-window-manager (thanks,
    Patrick Hétu; see LP #159363).
  * Make use of RAWMINSIZE, RAWCURSIZE, and RAWMAXSIZE variables from
    partman-partitioning 59ubuntu2 to set accurate bounds on the resize
    widget.

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Usability fixes for the timezone widget:
    - Make the hover-to-zoom areas relative to the widget size.
    - Zoom in on the location of the cursor, not the edge relative to its
      position.
    - Add a delay for zooming out.
  * Handle the migration-assistant UI being fed non-UTF data gracefully.
  * Make capitalization of migration-assistant consistent (LP: #225555).
  * Remember hostname between runs of ubiquity (LP: #40590).
  * Disable the close button for progress windows (LP: #107686).
  * Reset stay_on_page when the back button is pressed (LP: #235374).

  [ Mario Limonciello ]

ubiquity (1.8.6) hardy; urgency=low

  [ Luke Yelavich ]
  * bin/ubiquity-dm:
    - Move code relating to at-spi-registryd to ensure that a11y is loaded
      before the background and window manager. (LP: #197887)
    - Ensure that orca/onboard are only run if the a11y gconf key is set.
    - Don't show any background image if the v1 profile is selected, similar to
      what happens in the GNOME desktop with this profile enabled.
    - Do not drop privileges when running the window manager,
      gnome-settings-daemon, or any of the a11y tools. Privileges are still
      dropped when accessibility is not enabled.
    - Wait for 15 seconds before loading orca, to let the a11y framework settle,
      and prevent orca from zombifying. This is a workaround until a cleaner
      solution is found.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Fix console-setup seen flag handling; console-setup/layout and
    console-setup/variant need to be marked unseen even in automatic mode so
    that they get their defaults set correctly, so use a different method to
    avoid displaying the question in preseeded installations (LP: #188492).
  * Fix partition_too_small check only to warn about partitions that are not
    free space, are not marked as "do not use", and are marked for use with
    a filesystem.

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Automatic update of included source packages: grub-installer

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Move the map when the cursor is near an edge instead of whenever the
    cursor moves (LP: #214989, #195159).
  * Various fixes to the new tzmap.  Thanks Colin Watson.
    - Wait half a second before zooming in.
    - Zoom in from the position of the mouse, rather than the top left
      corner.
    - Widen the hover-to-move areas.
    - Find the closest hotspot if there are several nearby.
    - Zoom to 4.5x.
  * Removed 12system_partitions_formatted.  It now lives in partman-target.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: console-setup
    1.21ubuntu7, partman-target 54ubuntu6.

  * Update translations from Launchpad.
  * Fix typo in German welcome message (LP: #195075). This needs to be fixed
    in Launchpad or it *will* regress, but this will at least paper over it
    for 8.04.

   - Translate dialogues
   - Fix launching browser from release notes label

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * KDE frontend: Translate the partition create dialog too.
  * Fix crash if opening /cdrom/.disk/info fails (with Jonathan and Evan).
  * Show current filesystem type if it isn't currently being used for
    anything; now that partman no longer sets up automatic mount points for
    everything, the lack of filesystem types made it difficult to get any
    context on which partition was which.
  * Set /apps/nautilus/preferences/media_autorun_never to true during

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Make all text in the partitioner translatable (LP: #144741).
    Unfortunately we don't have time to get translations in place for 8.04,
    but there ought to be time to do this for 8.04.1. This also involved
    moving the "Undo changes to partitions" button to a second line in order
    to avoid excessive horizontal growth.
  * Adjust po-debconf flags in ubiquity/install/copying_error/md5, so that
    ${FILE} doesn't get translated.
  * Offer a list of mount points when creating a partition (LP: #85713).
    Adjust this list (and also that offered when editing a partition) if the
    file system is changed to FAT or NTFS.
  * Guard against division by zero while copying files (LP: #211503).
  * Ensure that "Location for the new partition" always defaults to
    "Beginning" (LP: #207810).
  * Stop X forwarding code from breaking if we aren't running within X
    (LP: #214211).

  * Copy the locale over to the target system when using oem-config.
    This was previously fixed for the alternate CD in LP 181291.
  * Use + instead of : for a replacement character for m-a as it is
    explicitly allowed by debconf policy.
  * Break out of resizing the partition in cases where partman fed us bad
    boundary values (LP: #197838).
  * Don't miscalculate with nested partitions in 03partition_too_small (LP:

      This shouldn't break anything since the Linux Mint seed explicitly
      depends upon metacity and Xubuntu upon xfwm4.
  * bin/ubiquity-dm:
    - Take command out of subprocess line for X to allow it to be started
      differently for different frontends.
  * Make VNC password readable.

  * Update imported translations from gtk+2.0 2.12.8-1.

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Overload get_oem_id in base frontend to avoid calling back into the

ubiquity (1.5.5) gutsy; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * KDE frontend: Disable the KDE media notifier for the entire duration of
    installation (LP: #122500).
  * Rename gtk-ui to gtk_ui and kde-ui to kde_ui, to make it easier to
    subclass them.
  * If oem-config/enable is true, then:
    - Adjust title bar to indicate that Ubiquity is running in OEM mode.
    - Hardcode the user's full name to "OEM Configuration (temporary user)",
      the username to "oem", and the UID to 29999.
    - Install the appropriate oem-config-FRONTEND package on the target
      system.
    - Install a desktop file for oem-config-prepare on the oem user's
      desktop.
    - Ask for a unique identifier for this batch of installations, and save
      that in /var/log/installer/oem-id on the installed system.
  * Add a warning in d-i/source/README about modifying files in this
    directory.

    - Fix full-name error reason widget, and make the error reasons
      selectable.
    - Suppress some spurious uncaught exceptions on startup.
    - Don't reconfigure the username entry box as a combo box if
      migration-assistant didn't find any users.
  * Replicate the apt configuration done by base-installer (trust CD-ROMs,
    allow unauthenticated packages if debian-installer/allow_unauthenticated
    is true, bind-mount /cdrom into /target, and configure apt-cdrom/apt not
    to mount CD-ROMs).
  * Install packages passed to apt-install even if they aren't on the live
    filesystem, as long as they're available from the apt archive on the CD
    (LP: #114296).

ubiquity (1.5.4) gutsy; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Make sure that the bounds of the spin button in the partition edit
    dialog always include the current size of the partition, even if for
    some reason it is outside the minimum/maximum resize ranges reported by
    partman, which can happen due to rounding errors in ubiquity/partman
    communication (part of #95619).
  * Save /var/log/casper.log to installed system (LP: #119993).
  * KDE frontend:
    - Say "Skip" (or translation thereof) rather than "Cancel" in progress
      dialog (LP: #116631).
    - Fix crash if one of the placeholder continent entries is selected as
      the timezone (LP: #112813).
  * From the department of pickiness: PEP-8 import ordering.
  * Move .glade and .ui files to a new top-level gui directory in the source
    package. Install .ui files in /usr/share/ubiquity/qt rather than in
    /usr/lib/ubiquity/ubiquity/frontend now that they are loaded on the fly
    rather than being compiled into .py files statically.
  * If /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules exists, copy it rather than
    generating /etc/iftab.

  [ Mario Limonciello ]
  * Break up the glade file into multiple pieces to make updates
    to single pages a lot easier.

  [ Nathan Collins ]
  * Fix typo in unionfs dirs= option generation (LP: #118742).

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Work around 122141 by keeping a reference to the button image.

    ubiquity.misc.
  * Clean up some breakage from ubiquity.misc.ex -> ubiquity.misc.execute
    renaming.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: console-setup 1.16ubuntu2,

ubiquity (1.5.0) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Fix escaping of migration-assistant summary.
  * Only display partitions with scheduled migrations in the summary, and
    improve the formatting slightly.
  * Remove another stray newline from the migration-assistant summary.
  * GTK frontend:
    - Pressing Enter in the migration-assistant user/password entry boxes
      activates the Forward button.
    - Drop X-Linux Mint-Gettext-Domain=ubiquity in the .desktop file for now, to
      work around a bug somewhere that causes the translations in the
      .desktop file to be ignored in that case.
    - Disable thunar automounting during installation (LP: #107259).
  * Remove the old advanced partitioner.
  * Use code based on shutil.copyfileobj rather than shutil.copyfile to copy
    files, avoiding a couple of unnecessary stats due to os.path.samefile.
  * Remove netcloner, noui, and text frontends, which are too out-of-date at
    the moment even to be worth using as examples. A reimplementation would
    need to start from scratch anyway.
  * Rename gtkui frontend to gtk-ui to match kde-ui (which had to be named
    that way due to a clash with python-kde3).
  * Update some copyright dates.
  * Split out internationalisation code from ubiquity.misc into
    ubiquity.i18n.
  * Remove some dead code from ubiquity.misc.
  * Create a BaseFrontend class and move various things to it; it now counts
    as a relatively clear specification of what a frontend has to implement.
  * Reorder some frontend methods to follow the ordering of the UI.
  * Fix crash if partman exits while the create or edit dialog is being
    displayed (LP: #108204).
  * Reconfigure /etc/papersize on installation (LP: #104160).
  * When changing values of debconf questions in /target, make sure to shut
    down debconf-communicate even if the Python debconf confmodule raises an
    exception.
  * Add an intro message noting that we're alpha again.
  * Rename ubiquity.misc.ex to ubiquity.misc.execute.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: apt-setup 1:0.21ubuntu1,

ubiquity (1.4.9) feisty; urgency=low

  * Suppress error dialog if the user quits while a debconffiltered process
    is running.
  * New partitioner: If the user tries to change multiple attributes of a
    partition at once, look each item up in the partman menu in sequence
    rather than looking them all up at the start. This makes it possible
    e.g. to change the method from one that doesn't support a mountpoint to
    one that does and set a mountpoint at the same time.
  * Update translations from Rosetta.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: console-setup
    1.13ubuntu13, partman-auto 62ubuntu10.

ubiquity (1.4.7) feisty; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Set PARTMAN_ALREADY_CHECKED when committing changes from the new
    advanced partitioner, to avoid duplicate warnings (LP: #100009).
  * Use debconf escape capability to simplify migration-assistant summary
    handling.
  * Update Japanese keyboard layout handling to match console-setup
    1.7ubuntu18, which uses jp(latin),jp by default (LP: #63915).
  * Display an error dialog if a subsidiary process fails (LP: #92442).
  * Update translations from Rosetta.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: console-setup
    1.13ubuntu12, migration-assistant 0.4.5, partman-base 105ubuntu3.

  [ Jonathan Riddell ]
  * KDE frontend
    - Disable all widgets in autopartition subchoices
      when selecting another parent choice
    - Fix misplaced widgets on user details page (LP: #86175)
    - Hide error messages from user info at start of each evaluation
    - Use Apport as crash handler when available
    - Add a graphical disk partition widget

  [ Evan Dandrea ]

    entire installer.

ubiquity (1.4.6) feisty; urgency=low

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon,  2 Apr 2007 02:05:20 +0100

ubiquity (1.4.5) feisty; urgency=low

  * Handle migration-assistant/failed-unmount being asked from ma-apply.
  * If installing or removing packages fails, then display a helpful error
    message and try to continue rather than crashing; furthermore, avoid
    installing language packs or removing packages when there are broken
    packages on the target system (LP: #54282, #69470, #80938).
  * Don't crash if Install exits due to SIGINT, SIGTERM, or SIGKILL, since
    these are probably user-generated.
  * Prepare for partman-partitioning/confirm_resize being asked during
    autopartitioning (partman-auto 62ubuntu9).
  * Do a better job of trying to get the exit code of subsidiary processes.
  * Update translations from Rosetta.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: hw-detect 1.45ubuntu3,

    - Add "Used" column (LP: #96126).
    - Pressing Enter in the create/edit dialog mount point entry box
      activates the OK button.
  * Old partitioner: Work around yet another hard-to-explain crash due to a
    partition being missing from /proc/partitions (LP: #73058).
  * KDE frontend:
    - Disable subsidiary autopartitioning options according to the primary
      selection (thanks to Thorbjørn Tux for prompting me with suggestions;
      LP: #85980).
    - Guard against on_partition_list_*_activate being called with no
      partition selected (LP: #95429).
  * Issue a debugging message any time a process exits, not just when it
    exits non-zero.
  * Disable migration-assistant if using the old partitioner: it crashes and
    is probably too much trouble to fix.
  * Avoid crashing in certain progressposition methods if no progress bar is
    running (LP: #51077).
  * Return to partitioning if you back up from partman-commit (LP: #78930).
  * Adjust ubiquity/text/partition_help, ubiquity/text/finished_label,

    size before setting the value to avoid the value being incorrectly
    clipped.

    have to do without the disk bar for Feisty at this point.
  * KDE frontend: Fix disk selection handling in automatic partitioner so
    that we stop always selecting the last disk no matter what (LP: #83010).
  * Reluctantly print error messages from main program to stdout rather than
    stderr, as gksudo swallows them otherwise.
  * Drop dependencies on gparted and qtparted. Instead, print a helpful

  * The Migration page now auto-fills the username box, matching the

    - Fix up step numbers if migration-assistant is disabled (LP: #85711).
    - Disable smooth zooming, as some video drivers are very slow at drawing

  * Merged in migration-assistant work. Moved the user-setup page to after
    migration-assistant (and thus also after the partitioner, since
    migration-assistant needs to know which partitions are to be left

    - Note that unadorned sizes are assumed to be in megabytes (LP: #82848).
    - Display current partition sizes in megabytes (part of LP: #83166).
    - Implement resizing. Ask for the size using a spinbutton (in megabytes)
      rather than a text entry field.
    - Offer 'fat16' and 'fat32' filesystem types for new partitions rather
      than the non-existent 'fat' (LP: #83211).
    - Fix crash when backing up to automatic partitioning page (LP: #83230).

  * Don't say "beta version" in the alpha intro message.
  * Move language list box to the left-hand side of its page rather than the
    bottom, on the basis that you have to choose a language before you can
    read the text.

    note).
  * Add special cases to restore correct handling of Chinese and Portuguese

    release notes on the language page. See doc/README for the format
    (https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/ubiquity-release-notes).
  * Remove no-longer-canonical /distros from Launchpad URLs.
  * Sync up hostname handling with netcfg; it now allows hostnames between 2
    and 63 characters in length, forbids them starting or ending with a

    reduces the need for strange environment variables.
  * Add command-line option handling: --debug is equivalent to the old
    UBIQUITY_DEBUG environment variable, while --cdebconf is new (and
    experimental). Combined with the above change, this means that the
    clumsy and frontend-dependent 'gksudo env UBIQUITY_DEBUG=1 ubiquity' or

  * Fix incorrect loop variable reuse in do_remove, and attempt multiple
    broken package resolution passes while removing packages (closes: Malone
    #66406).
  * Detect existing HFS bootstrap partitions during automatic partitioning
    and take account of them while validating mountpoints (closes: Malone
    #66384).
  * Fix crash on keyboard page if you select a layout with no variants.
  * Remove kernels before running update-initramfs so that we update the
    correct initramfs on powerpc. Make sure to fix up kernel/initrd symlinks
    after running update-initramfs, so that we have something to which to
    point the initrd symlink.

    duplicates).
  * GTK frontend: Disable back and forward buttons while gparted is starting
    up. Requires gparted (>= 0.2.5-1.1ubuntu11).
  * GTK frontend: Avoid calling gtk.main_quit if a main loop isn't running,
    as further insurance against Malone #54163.

    features.
  * Add a FAQ about backporting to doc/README.
  * Document ubiquity/install/filesystem-images in doc/README.
  * autogen.sh: Force use of automake-1.8 and aclocal-1.8.
  * Move auxiliary autotools files to a build subdirectory.
  * Add a check to debian/rules to remind me to bump the version number in
    configure.ac.
  * Read partition flags from gparted (>= 0.2.5-1.1ubuntu9). Display an
    error on the mountpoints page if running on powerpc and there is no HFS
    partition with the boot flag set. Treat HFS partitions with the boot
    flag set as NewWorld bootstrap partitions (closes: Malone #43768).
  * GTK frontend: Add a keyboard variant selector (closes: Malone #61729).
    (The same needs to be done for the KDE frontend.)
  * Remove old kbd-chooser component, which won't be usable any more.
  * Send stderr to /var/log/installer/debug if UBIQUITY_DEBUG is set.
  * Send DEBCONF_DEBUG=filter output to stderr, not syslog; it should be
    interleaved with DEBCONF_DEBUG=developer output.
  * GTK frontend: Throw away stderr from gnome-screensaver-command; it
    outputs far too much rubbish and confuses users.
  * KDE frontend: Fix reboot dialog button handling (closes: Malone #62765).
  * Replace the rather jittery time-remaining message while copying files
    with a message that appears when there's less than a minute remaining

    starting console-setup, to avoid incorrect variant choices (although I
    think there's also a console-setup bug here in that the variants are
    being substituted in the wrong order).

    points (closes: Malone #56789).
  * Fix timezone component to deal with frontend.get_timezone returning None
    (closes: Malone #42865).
  * Use more sensible default cities for languages with country shortlists
    (i.e. the intended default rather than the first in alphabetical order
    of country code), working around a missing feature in debconf.
  * Pick a sensible default city for countries with multiple zones but no
    explicit default city (closes: Malone #43914).
  * Remove obsolete Recommends: gparted from ubiquity; ubiquity-frontend-gtk
    already depends on it.
  * Feed not-yet-formatted partition state back into gparted when starting
    it up, so that newly-created partitions aren't listed as "unknown" when
    you go back (requires gparted 0.2.5-1.1ubuntu8; closes: Malone #40404).
  * Fix use of gobject.spawn_async in
    gnome-screensaver-command/xscreensaver-command, broken in 1.1.19.
  * Make sure that "Restart now" is the default option on the final dialog
    (closes: Malone #61517).
  * Log warnings in various cases when partitions are ignored on the
    mountpoints page.
  * GTK frontend: For some reason GtkTable doesn't seem to queue a resize
    itself when you attach children to it, so the mountpoints table was
    showing up blank the first time through. Worked around this.
  * Add/update translations from Rosetta: Arabic, Belarusian, Bulgarian,
    Breton, Danish, German, Greek, Spanish, Basque, Finnish, French, Hindi,

  * Ignore failures from os.utime on directories. I don't know why I get a
    disproportionate number of reports of this failing, but to be honest I
    don't care enough about directory timestamps to investigate.
  * Add trivial pid file locking, allowing ubiquity to exit gracefully if
    you try to run more than one instance of it at once; previously it blew
    up much more spectacularly upon finding that the debconf database was
    locked (closes: Malone #46569).

    still need to add a UI element for the keyboard variant, and
    translations of layout and variant names are missing, but it mostly
    seems to work.
  * Strip Fonts and Keyboard directories from our copy of console-setup;
    they're very large, and not needed since we don't actually build
    console-setup, but just copy a few scripts from it.
  * Add a ubiquity/install/filesystem-images template, which can be

    space-separated images are given, then they will be overlaid using
    unionfs
    (https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/live-cd-stacked-filesystems).

  * Fix misc.ex to use subprocess.call properly rather than smashing
    arguments together and invoking them via the shell.
  * Remove duplicate logging from Install.chrex.
  * Remove /var/log/installer/syslog from all error messages etc., as
    everything goes to /var/log/syslog now. /var/log/syslog is now copied to
    /var/log/installer/syslog on the target system.
  * Automatically set UBIQUITY_NO_GTK or UBIQUITY_NO_KDE to disable building
    frontends as appropriate if tools are missing (pygtk-codegen-2.0 for the
    GTK frontend, kdepyuic for the KDE frontend). This should never happen
    in normal builds, but saves typing when building test versions.
  * Teach DebconfFilter to send escaped replies when CAPB escape is set.
  * Fix substitution variable for full name in ubiquity/summary.
  * I never really understood the whole control flow around the summary
    page, and I wrote it! Take advantage of the partman-commit script added
    in partman-base 90ubuntu4, so that instead we shut down partman, run the
    summary page, and then start it back up to commit changes. The
    PartmanCommit component is now used for both automatic and manual

ubiquity (1.1.3) edgy; urgency=low

  * Fix typoed variable name while raising InstallStepError.
  * Rename Partman component to PartmanAuto to allow for a future all-in-one
    partman component
    (https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/ubiquity-advanced-partitioner).
  * When an error occurs with the install progress bar up, only return to
    autopartitioning if the partitioner is still running.
  * Turn DebconfInstallProgress upside-down so that the main process handles
    apt installation and the subprocess handles the translation of apt
    status messages into debconf protocol messages, rather than the other
    way round. The previous approach resulted in exceptions from apt ending
    up in the wrong process.
  * Silence apt errors while installing language packs, since we ignore them
    anyway.
  * Point apt at /target/var/lib/dpkg/status rather than
    /var/lib/dpkg/status (closes: Malone #47859).
  * Handle new initramfs-tools configuration directory.
  * Set debconf's escape capability when fetching extended descriptions,
    since they're potentially multi-line.
  * Use partman's confirmation message rather than generating it ourselves,
    now that its use of multi-line SUBSTs has been fixed (closes: Malone
    #47043).
  * Make the rest of the summary text translatable.
  * Display grub-installer/install_to_xfs question if it's asked.
  * Fix get_filesystems() not to assume ext3 in quite so many situations.
  * Detect XFS for validation purposes even when it wasn't just formatted by
    gparted/qtparted (closes: Malone #53642).
  * Fix all mentions of gparted in the KDE frontend.
  * Leave existing newworld boot partitions alone when committing manual
    partitioning changes.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: localechooser
    1.20ubuntu4, partman-auto 54ubuntu2, partman-base 90ubuntu2.

  * Use 'replace' Unicode error handling when dealing with data coming from
    debconf (closes: Malone #44595, #48732).
  * Fix ubiquity/install/apt_error_install and
    ubiquity/install/apt_error_remove templates to be of type 'error'
    (closes: Malone #53258).
  * Install more defence against gparted/qtparted crashing (closes: Malone
    #47194, #48856).
  * If gparted or qtparted crashes, put up a dialog allowing the user to try
    again, return to autopartitioning, or quit the installer. This is a
    pretty awful hack, but hopefully we won't be using gparted/qtparted for
    all that much longer ...
  * Fix crash in KDE frontend while translating widgets (closes: Malone
    #53367).

ubiquity (1.1.0) edgy; urgency=low

  * Use try/finally in install.py to ensure that PROGRESS STOP is always
    called; ignore errors from PROGRESS STOP (e.g. because debconf has gone
    away due to a previous error).
  * Support /UNIONFS (Knoppix) as well as /rofs as the read-only filesystem
    source.
  * Don't require entering a full name (see
    http://www.hermann-uwe.de/blog/os-install-experiences-part-4-ubuntu).
  * GTK frontend:
    - Return None from location_from_point if point is None (thanks to Chris
      Moore for the idea; closes: Malone #48885).
  * KDE frontend:
    - Add slightly more paranoia in case getNearestCity returns None.
  * Don't show hw-detect/modprobe_error, and make it non-fatal (closes:
    Malone #48524).
  * Make it clear in the crash dialog that you should file a new bug, not
    attach your details to an existing bug.
  * Add passwd and adduser dependencies from user-setup.
  * Take a copy of the supplied choice map in set_keyboard_choices.
  * Save tracebacks from install.py and slurp them back into the traceback
    displayed if install.py exits non-zero.
  * Convert to new Python policy (python-central). Install Python
    modules/extensions to /usr/lib/ubiquity/ubiquity rather than into the
    public module path.
  * Warn in the partitioner if you try to use XFS for /boot (closes: Malone
    #47848).
  * Warn in the partitioner if system filesystems are not reformatted
    (closes: Malone #47046).
  * Remove /usr/bin/espresso compatibility symlink.
  * Use os._exit() rather than sys.exit() in the apt install progress child
    process after forking, fixing a lot of strange "PROGRESS STOP" messages
    in /var/log/installer/syslog and bizarre debconf exceptions. See also
    Malone #53298.
  * Use exceptions to communicate all failures in install.py, so that we get
    more useful tracebacks.

  * Explicitly refer to /var/log/installer/syslog and /var/log/syslog for

  * Ask for /var/log/syslog in the crash dialog text as well (in case it
    does get read); some errors land there rather than
    /var/log/installer/syslog. (I'll consolidate the logging a bit after the
    Dapper release.)
  * When copying symlinks, check for existing dangling symlinks as well as
    other types of file (closes: Malone #47054).

    text (getting the exact reason for the crash is unfortunately
    difficult). Add text to the crash handler to ask the user to attach
    /var/log/installer/syslog and /var/log/partman to bug reports so that we

    - Pass desired filesystem type from gparted to partman (closes: Malone
      #34921). Requires partman (>= 78ubuntu1+11).
  * Fix logging functions not to use eval, so that they don't break when
    asked to log something containing "'" characters.
  * Add part_devices instance variables to the GTK and KDE frontends to
    avoid horribleness when trying to map a partition label back to a device
    name.
  * Perform network configuration: we copy /etc/network/interfaces and
    /etc/resolv.conf, write /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts afresh based on the
    selected hostname, and write /etc/iftab afresh based on the interfaces
    present (closes: Malone #33064). Eventually most of this should be
    replaced by a call to netcfg, but that's difficult at the moment.
  * Add explicit text with a language question to the language screen
    (closes: Malone #36973).

  * KDE frontend:
    - merge with GTK, adds disk selection page

  * Make life easier for components called from Install: support extra
    environment variables returned from prepare(), and allow an existing
    Debconf instance to be passed in the constructor.

espresso (0.99.35) dapper; urgency=low

  * Fix estimated install copying time. We no longer use cpio to do the
    copying, but instead do the whole thing in-process. This lets us avoid
    buffering issues.
  * Avoid a long pause without any info message while updating apt's indices
    before downloading language packs.
  * GTK frontend:
    - Enlarge primary text in progress windows, per the GNOME HIG.
    - Turn debconf progress dialog into a normal progress window, since it
      doesn't have any buttons.
    - Allow the label above the keyboard test box to wrap.

  * GTK frontend:
    - Remove remaining Spanish strings. Make some of these translatable
      using existing strings in partman; the rest will follow later.
    - In manual partitioning, only mark partitions automatically mounted on
      swap, /, /usr, /var, or /boot to be reformatted by default.
    - Honour the desired type of a filesystem newly created in gparted in
      preference to its current detected type.
    - If a newly-created filesystem is selected, disable the Reformat
      checkbox and force it on, as it makes no sense off.
  * Exempt swap from duplicate mountpoint checks (part of Malone #34465).
  * Fix crash when reporting that a partition is too small.
  * Make the estimated install copying time a bit less madly wrong (it was
    estimating based on the total file size rather than the amount left to
    copy), although I think buffering on cpio's stdin is still causing it to
    be pretty badly out most of the time.

    - Make sure that cancelling the installation at the summary page cancels
      partman too.
    - Make "Installation complete" translatable.
  * Make sure that debconffilter never tries to call the same widget more
    than once for a single command.
  * Move more frontend-independent translation logic from the GTK frontend

    annoying was also implemented in a way that made our lives difficult for
    internationalisation.
  * Add internationalisation support for those strings that don't come from
    d-i, with translations stored in debconf templates. I've only set this
    up in the GTK frontend so far, but it should be straightforward to do
    elsewhere. Requires espresso-locale (>= 0.27ubuntu11).

    - Change the summary text box to a selectable label so that it gets the

  * GTK frontend:
    - Add a test box to the keymap page. (Note that your keymap isn't
      actually changed in the installer at the moment, so this won't work
      yet.)
    - Display the current time in the format used by the currently-selected
      locale.
  * GTK and KDE frontends:
    - Move the keymap page after the location page, so that in future the
      keymap page can be initialised using data for the selected country.
  * Make espresso.tz.SystemTzInfo.dst() pretend that DST is not in effect if
    we have no DST information, rather than returning the more correct None;
    this allows fromutc() to be used reliably.
  * Use espresso-yaboot to install yaboot on powerpc systems.

    - Rearrange help text on advanced partitioning pages to allow for more
      space on the screen where it matters.
    - Show the current time in the selected timezone on the location page.
    - Translate more strings from Spanish to English.
    - Use HH:MM for UTC offsets rather than fractions of hours.
    - Refer to UTC offsets as GMT offsets instead; it's not quite 100%
      accurate, but (we think) more widely understood.
    - Add a border around the timezone map.
    - Change identification page heading to "Who are you?".
    - Reorganise locale page so that the language select box is in the
      middle rather than at the left-hand side, and shorter.
    - Drop the notebook border.
    - Remove the expander and the "Details" label from the summary page, per
      feedback from the UI sprint.
    - Make the first click on the timezone map zoom in but not select a
      city; the second click will select a city.

espresso (0.99.18) dapper; urgency=low

  * Rip all the /target unmounting code out of espresso.backend.copy and do
    it in the main espresso program just before exiting.
  * Parse /proc/mounts for mountpoints to unmount; this saves having to have
    a get_mountpoints method in every frontend.
  * Unmount /target before starting the frontend, since we will behave badly
    if /target is still mounted from a previous installation attempt.

  * Handle all PROGRESS commands entirely in debconffilter, without passing
    them through to the debconf frontend.
  * Add a PROGRESS REGION extension to debconffilter, and a ProgressPosition
    class to keep track of progress bar regions; allows a single progress
    bar to be subdivided into pieces for different stages.
  * Hack FilteredCommand.run_command() to execute the command without any
    debconffiltering glue if frontend is None; this allows nested
    FilteredCommands to more or less work.
  * Stop FilteredCommand.error() from running a UI loop; we assume that the
    frontend's error_dialog() method runs synchronously.

  * Move espresso/components/summary to a new scripts directory.
  * Rework copy and configuration progress bars using debconffilter. This
    fixes some responsiveness bugs, allows for localisation, and finally
    unifies all progress bar handling.
  * Add debconf template translation boilerplate.

  * Move call_gparted from espresso.backend.part into the GTK frontend, as
    it's widget-set-dependent. Unhardcode the path to gparted.
  * Remove espresso/backend/, none of which is used any more except by the
    netcloner and noui frontends which are both broken at the moment anyway.
    The frontend/backend division is now between espresso.frontend and
    espresso.components, mediated by debconffilter.

  * Make espresso-frontend-gtk Architecture: any, due to the Evolution map
    widget (closes: Malone #32874).
  * Build Evolution map widget and Python bindings with -fPIC; should fix
    build failure on amd64.
  * Only enable the TimezoneMap.flash_selected_point handler when the
    timezone map is visible.
  * Remove text that claims /home will not be formatted; partly fixes Malone
    #32534.
  * Display an error dialog on GRUB installation failures (closes: Malone
    #32047; grub has been seeded, so this shouldn't generally happen any
    more anyway).
  * Notice and exit on errors from the copy and configuration stages.

    messages appear there more quickly during testing.
  * Fix debconffilter to handle SET and SUBST commands whose values consist
    of more than one word.
  * Add a "Ready to install" summary page. (It doesn't contain all the
    necessary information yet, and it should run before partitioning is
    committed rather than after, but that will be easy to fix later.)

  * Add a language page, using espresso-locale. The locale is set in the
    target system and used for debconf coprocesses, although not yet for
    translatable strings in the Espresso core.
  * Add a FilteredCommand.cleanup() hook that can be overridden by
    components to perform cleanup tasks after their subprocess exits.
  * Stop logging every single file we copy to /var/log/installer/espresso;

espresso (0.99.1) dapper; urgency=low

  * Rename to espresso to avoid confusion caused by somebody other than
    Linux Mint being upstream for a project called "Linux Mint ...", to reduce
    awkward branding considerations, and to clearly separate the work being
    done on this project for Dapper from the work done by Guadalinex since
    the focus is rather different.
  * Change Maintainer to me.
  * Rename lib directory in source to espresso so that pychecker can be used
    more easily.
  * Log to /var/log/installer/espresso instead of /var/log/<distro>-express.
  * Change all uses of express/* debconf questions to real questions where
    possible, and espresso/* where not.

  * Add debconffilter.py from oem-config (this has been sent to debconf
    upstream and may eventually make it in there instead). We'll use this
    for d-i integration.
  * Adjust debconffilter to filter out STOP.
  * Add generic error question handling, METAGET filtering, SUBST filtering,
    and PROGRESS filtering to debconffilter.
  * Ignore unknown commands in debconffilter, since some programs (hi,
    partman!) use multi-line commands despite them only working in cdebconf
    by fluke.
  * Add debconfcommunicator.py too; it's been committed to debconf upstream,
    but it's useful here anyway for backports to breezy.
  * Add rudimentary FilteredCommand class, a convenience wrapper around
    DebconfFilter that makes it easier to test various things.
  * Add filtered debconf progress bar handling in the GTK frontend.

  * Add apt-install and udpkg compatibility shims.
  * Call user-setup as a debconffilter coprocess while running the
    corresponding UI step, replacing our own duplicated validation code.
  * Call partman as a debconffilter coprocess while running the
    autopartitioning UI step. Remove peez2 entirely, as this will replace it
    once it's finished.
  * Change gparted invocation to use new --installer=WID option.
  * Replace hand-rolled partition formatting and mounting code with a call
    to PartmanCommit.
  * Copy from /rofs if it exists, rather than hunting through the CD for the
    filesystem image. Requires casper 1.25.
  * Run hook scripts in /usr/lib/espresso/target-config (filenames
    containing '.' are ignored) so that casper can propagate appropriate
    parts of its configuration to the target system.
  * Remove all references to base-config; timezone configuration now
    requires a .deb of the new tzsetup.
  * Use espresso-grub for GRUB installation rather than doing it by hand.
  * Drop dependency on yaboot | grub.

  * Refer to ubuntu.com everywhere, not the deprecated ubuntulinux.org.
  * Don't use full-screen mode.
  * Don't keep the GTK user interface window on top; it's annoying during
    development, and arguable at best in production.
  * Remove the numbers from the breadcrumb trail at the top of the screen.
  * Disable embedded web browser for now since this segfaults in current
    dapper (Bugzilla #20338). For the time being, replace it with a scary
    message telling users to be sure to BACK UP THEIR DATA FIRST.
  * Translate strings in glade file and progress queue messages to English.
    In the unlikely event that any of the strings remain basically
    identical, I'll restore the original text as a Spanish translation.
  * In general, don't send a progress queue message when completing a task,
    only when starting one. There's no point constructing translatable text
    that's only going to be on the screen for tiny fractions of a second
    anyway.
  * Strip newlines from lines in messages.txt.
  * Get rid of almost-useless help button. In general, the UI should be made
    self-explanatory rather than requiring extra clicks to get at help
    information.

  * Fix Config.get_locales() using DebconfCommunicator.
  * Try fetching timezone from /etc/localtime as well as from /etc/timezone.
  * Handle missing keymap and/or locale debconf questions.
  * Fix kernel version detection.
  * Use 'lsb_release -is' rather than reading /etc/lsb-release directly.
  * Depend on lsb-release.
  * Don't preselect a mount point for /home.
  * Fix unmounting at end of installation.
  * Remove ubuntu-express wrapper script; eventually we'll do whatever
    unmounting is necessary during the partitioning step rather than turning
    off swap for the whole installer (and partman should help with this
    already).
  * Install installer script as /usr/bin/espresso rather than
    /usr/bin/installer.
  * Quieten cpio a bit.

  * Use dh_installdocs to install documentation.
  * Remove unnecessary ${shlibs:Depends} dependencies.
  * Fix broken use of debhelper; the author seemed to be confusing -A and
    -a, and in any case we only build architecture-independent packages.
  * Use dh_install instead of verbose code in debian/rules (which includes a
    bashism anyway).
  * Remove hardcoded svn commands in generate-doc.sh.
  * Remove svn exclusion stuff in debian/rules; if building from a
    Subversion checkout, you should use standard workarounds to avoid .svn
    directories.
  * Remove generated source code documentation for now; it's really not
    terribly useful, certainly not in the espresso binary package, and
    ultimately it should be generated as part of the build process if at
    all.
  * Rewrite descriptions to be better English and (I hope) more useful.
