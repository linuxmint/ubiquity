ubiquity (2.0.5) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Do not fail if linux-generic-pae is not in the package cache.
    Thanks Colin Watson (LP: #461377).
  * Really don't run oem-config again.  Thanks Colin Watson
    (LP: #461546).
  * Fix broken reference in the apport hook (LP: #461757).
  * Add noninteractive pages for user-setup and migrationassistant as
    well.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: user-setup
    1.27ubuntu11.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Run partman in the noninteractive frontend (otherwise we try to install
    to the live CD root!).
  * Explicitly print noninteractive output to the console (as the Python
    debconf module redirects sys.stdout to sys.stderr which ends up in
    /var/log/installer/debug).

ubiquity (2.0.4) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Do not install the live CD kernel in the target system when using
    PAE (LP: #413135).
  * Properly set the kernel version in the main install process when
    using PAE so that symlinks get created for the kernel and initramfs.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: partman-base
    133ubuntu4.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: grub-installer
    1.43ubuntu8, partman-basicmethods 43ubuntu1.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Change apport hook to prefer syslog, partman, and casper.log from
    /var/log/installer/ if they exist there, to support bug-filing after
    installation.
  * Don't set the "incomplete language support" note if only gimp-help-* is
    missing, since it's far too big to fit on CDs (LP: #452516).
  * Furthermore, always consider English as "complete enough". The packages
    that are missing from an installation from the Ubuntu desktop CD are not
    critical for a reasonable user experience.
  * Make use of check-language-support -a if pkgsel/language-packs is ALL,
    since that's orders of magnitude faster (LP: #458333).
  * Keep language-support-$LL installed if it happens to be in the live
    filesystem, since there's no point spending time removing it; but don't
    install it if it isn't in the live filesystem (LP: #458333).

ubiquity (2.0.3) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Use new check-language-support --show-installed option added in
    language-selector 0.4.16, so that we can arrange to keep language
    support packages installed that are already present in the live
    filesystem.

  [ Mario Limonciello ]
  * Pass the debug parameters to ubiquity even if running in noninteractive
    mode.
  * Don't provide the old init scripts, even under a temporary name anymore.
    - It appears that there is a race condition that can exist between when
      the upstart'ified version and the initscript version start that may cause
      only-ubiquity and automatic-ubiquity to (poorly) fail. (LP: #457858)    
    - All login managers in use (gdm and kdm) have converted to upstart now.

  * Check to see whether X crashed or ubiquity crashed before attempting
    to bail into the noninteractive frontend from only-ubiquity mode
    (LP: #444901).
  * Wrap the format warning label while working around GTK+ label layout
    problems (LP: #364617).

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Rewrite X_LOADTEMPLATEFILE commands in case they refer to template files
    in the /target chroot (LP: #452118).
  * Install -generic-pae kernels if necessary; this requires some custom
    hacks since -generic-pae isn't in the live filesystem (LP: #413135).
  * Don't do kernel installation/removal in oem-config.
  * Skip partition_too_small check during Wubi installs, as Wubi does some
    of its own checks and the delay imposed by this check looks particularly
    weird in Wubi. This may or may not be the cause of apparent hangs
    towards the end of partitioning, but I suspect that it will at least get
    rid of some conflated reports and make testing quicker.
  * Update translations from Launchpad.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: clock-setup 0.98ubuntu3,
    flash-kernel 2.13ubuntu13, grub-installer 1.43ubuntu6, partman-auto
    89ubuntu2, partman-target 64ubuntu4.

ubiquity (2.0.0) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Bump to a stable version number series for Ubuntu 9.10.

    The main reason for the version bump was because we incorporated
    oem-config and needed to jump past its version numbers, but really
    Ubiquity 2.0.0 is quite different from Ubiquity 1.0.0 despite most of
    the changes being gradual and incremental. 3.5 years and nearly 5000
    lines of changelog entries later, we have several active developers,
    lots more translations, apport integration, a new partitioner,
    migration-assistant, automation, Mythbuntu and noninteractive frontends,
    Wubi, reinstallation without reformatting, a new timezone map,
    accessibility, many UI improvements, a slideshow, plugin support, and
    much more. Here's to version 3!

  * Install kernel headers to match the kernel (LP: #413135).
  * Recommend dmraid to ensure consistent behaviour across Ubuntu flavours
    (it was already present on the Ubuntu desktop CD, but e.g. not on
    Kubuntu).
  * If dmraid devices are active, then create
    /var/lib/disk-detect/activate_dmraid so that partman will exclude slave
    devices, and ensure that dmraid is installed in the target (LP: #90235).
  * Use check-language-support if available to select language support
    packages (LP: #434173).
  * Update translations from Launchpad.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: base-installer
    1.102ubuntu2, hw-detect 1.72ubuntu5.

  [ Jonathan Riddell ]
  * ubi-intro.py: detect kubuntu-netbook-intro.txt if it exists and use
    that as warning for Kubuntu Netbook Edition

ubiquity (1.99.29) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Use a separate PROGRESS REGION for each install plugin (LP: #438979).
  * GTK frontend:
    - When switching language, translate other top-level widgets (dialogs)
      and their children, as well as the main notebook pages (LP: #441622).
  * Install a dummy initctl similar to the dummy start-stop-daemon while
    doing anything that might install or remove packages in the target
    system, so that attempts to control Upstart jobs won't do anything.
  * Stop Upstart jobs when switching to runlevel 0 or 6, which I think fixes
    repeated respawns on shutdown (LP: #432140).
  * Save /var/log/installer/debug to the target system if it exists.
  * In the auto-resize bar, use the preferred partition size requested by
    partman-auto/partman-partitioning, rather than hardcoding the maximum
    size or making up our own (LP: #421407).
  * Update imported translations from gtk+2.0 2.18.1-1ubuntu1 (adds Asturian
    and Bengali).
  * Update translations from Launchpad.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: apt-setup 1:0.41ubuntu2,
    console-setup 1.34ubuntu4, flash-kernel 2.13ubuntu12, grub-installer
    1.43ubuntu5, partman-partitioning 72ubuntu2, partman-target 64ubuntu2.

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Port fix for return_to_partitioning from the GTK+ frontend to the
    KDE frontend (LP: #439184).
  * Explicitly depend on reiserfsprogs so that we don't have to add it
    to every live seed (LP: #431976).
  * Write /cdrom/.disk/info to /var/log/installer/media-info
    (LP: #364649).

ubiquity (1.99.25) karmic; urgency=low

  * d-i/get-sources: Clear Dir::Etc::sourceparts, so that any local

  * Reorganise clock handling. The system wall clock is now set as early as
    possible, and not reset after partitioning; and the timezone and
    hardware clock configuration are now changed in the live filesystem root
    as well as in /target (LP: #431786).

ubiquity (1.99.23) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Add missing definition of self.controller for the noninteractive
    page in the language plugin.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Use an explicit state file to determine whether oem-config runs, since
    with Upstart it's no longer straightforward to just add/remove rc*.d
    symlinks (LP: #432180).
  * We already avoid copy-blacklisting files in packages that have a prerm,
    since they might require non-trivial work before removing their files.
    Now also avoid copy-blacklisting files in dependencies of such packages,
    as otherwise we risk leaving programs in the target system for a while
    that don't have their library dependencies satisfied, causing confusion
    when other programs try to use them (LP: #436613).

  * Disable the forward button for the usersetup page when coming from
    both the automatic and manual partitioning pages, rather than just
    the latter.
  * Open a browser window when links are clicked on in the slideshow
    (LP: #432145).

  * Mythbuntu Frontend:
    - Explicitly allow the user to progress when the graphics driver is

      card, the installer would be stuck on this page because of being in
      automatic mode.  This page is not shown on Non-NVIDIA or AMD systems.
    - Be more specific about packages that are removed in role selection.
      Unfortunately prior to this fix, choosing a Frontend role for example
      was not cleaning up mysql, apache, or mythtv-backend (completely 
      defeating the purpose of a frontend role).

    (LP: #364181).
  * Add translation support for the "Free Space" string in the GTK frontend

  * Re-enable the alpha intro message.
  * Provide better labels for the partition buttons (LP: #336764).

  * Add support for displaying the "Use the largest continuous free space"

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Fix stripping of '=dev=' from device names when creating partition bars
    to avoid reducing e.g. '=dev=vda' to 'a' (LP: #362466).
  * KDE frontend:
    - Start the resize slider at the maximum possible size for the partition
      being resized; this is in line with the GTK frontend, and fixes the
      situation where the previous default (half-way between the minimum
      size and the current size) is out of range.
    - Use a better colour to represent the results of automatic partitioning
      (LP: #348461).
  * Preseed tzsetup/selected up-front rather than filtering it and then
    preseeding it; filtering it causes the backup state to be reset, which
    causes an infinite loop when backing up from the timezone page when the
    default country only has one timezone (LP: #361674).
  * Preseed passwd/auto-login-backup=oem in OEM mode, so that the original
    configuration files are available for restoration (LP: #361272).
  * Add a little extra state machine debugging to the partman component.
  * If an error/question dialog is displayed while changing steps is
    disabled, we currently need to re-enable changing steps in order to get
    a normal cursor, but that also enables the Back/Forward buttons and
    allows people to violate assertions by being too quick (e.g. selecting
    an autopartitioning choice while the installer is still busy analysing
    the possible choices). We should clean this up properly later, but for
    now just restore the allowed-change-step state when the dialog is
    finished.
  * Fix preseeding of the autopartitioning question to work in automatic
    mode: it needs to be preseeded as unseen, otherwise going back from a
    confirmation question doesn't work (LP: #361828). Remove an old code
    path that would have been very complicated to fix for this and is
    guaranteed to never be used nowadays.
  * Update translations from Launchpad.

    - port reboot code to KDE 4, (LP: #360838)

  * Update for new message context system in GTK+ 2.15.1, and update
    imported translations from gtk+2.0 2.16.0-1ubuntu2.
  * Stop setting message attribute in InstallStepError; it isn't used and it
    generates a deprecation warning with Python 2.6. Similarly, rename
    PartedServerError's message attribute to parted_error.
  * Always set auto-login for OEM installations.
  * KDE frontend:
    - Hide auto-login and require-password radio buttons for OEM
      installations.
  * Remove reimplementation of gdm and kdm auto-login support for OEM
    installations, since user-setup handles this now and the duplication
    causes oem-config to be unable to undo autologin (LP: #347900).
  * Fix ubiquity/install_bootloader handling (LP: #348660):
    - Check the seen flag rather its value when deciding whether to override
      it with the UI's value.
    - Outside automatic mode, default the UI's "Install boot loader"
      question to the value of ubiquity/install_bootloader.
  * Offer "Yes" and "No" choices for user-setup/password-weak (LP: #349173).
  * Depend on grub | grub-pc, and don't remove grub-pc until after
    grub-installer has had the chance to decide whether it wants to use it
    (LP: #349835).
  * Add a compatibility wrapper for update-dev to ensure that it never
    attempts to call 'udevadm trigger', which isn't necessary in ubiquity
    and can cause problems (LP: #349937).
  * Permit dmraid-style /dev/mapper/* device names in advanced boot loader
    selector, as well as disk and partition numbers over 9 (LP: #342354).
  * Remove /target/var/lib/apt-xapian-index per Michael Vogt, since it needs
    to be rebuilt based on the installed system's sources.list, and apt's
    cron.daily script and/or synaptic will do this.
  * Preserve ordering of automatic partitioning choices when replacing them

  * Work in bytes rather than percentages in the partition bar code

  * Fix partition bar slider (for resizing) code by adding correct

  * Properly encode data from os-prober (LP: #345573).
  * Make sure that the before and after partitioning bars use the same
    colors for the same partitions (LP: #289324).
  * Fix the placement of the partition bars in scrolled windows when
    necessary.
  * Don't let the partition bars eat up any extra space.
  * Move selecting a disk from radio buttons to a drop down box on the

  * broken_packages is fairly slow due to having to iterate over the whole

  * Stop the user-setup component from believing it's done after the user

  * Add ubiquity/keep-installed question which can be preseeded with a
    space-separated list of packages to keep installed even if they aren't
    in the desktop manifest and aren't in the list of language packs to keep
    (LP: #290400).
  * Expand dependencies of packages we know we want to keep (language packs,
    etc.) before calculating which packages to blacklist from file copying
    or to remove. This is more correct in the presence of Recommends of
    language packs, and furthermore saves considerable time when
    blacklisting. My test results for various language pack sets on a DVD:
    - en: 4:00 -> 3:30
    - de+en+es+fr+ja+ko+nb+nds+nl+nn+si+sk+sv: 5:30 -> 2:50
    - all: 14:37 -> 0:10 (!)
    This doesn't quite solve LP #335596 because testing a large number of
    packages for removal when there genuinely are lots of packages to remove
    is still quite slow, but it very significantly improves the worst cases.

  * Fix excessive file-copy blacklisting, which had several problems
    (LP: #285238):
    - wasn't deciding which language packs to use before generating the

    - was filtering out packages with prerms before doing ok-to-remove
      calculations;
    - needed to try recursively removing broken packages in order to get a
      fully-expanded list of reverse-dependencies out of apt;
    - was removing packages from the difference list too early so they
      stopped being considered as packages that were allowed to be removed.
    In an attempt to make this rather large change a little more reviewable,
    note that the code used to analyse removals while generating the
    blacklist is now the same as that used to remove unused packages later
    in the installation process.

  * Silence deprecation warning in zoommap.
  * Add ubiquity-dm implementation for matchbox-window-manager (thanks,

  * Make use of RAWMINSIZE, RAWCURSIZE, and RAWMAXSIZE variables from
    partman-partitioning 59ubuntu2 to set accurate bounds on the resize
    widget.

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Usability fixes for the timezone widget:
    - Make the hover-to-zoom areas relative to the widget size.
    - Zoom in on the location of the cursor, not the edge relative to its
      position.
    - Add a delay for zooming out.
  * Handle the migration-assistant UI being fed non-UTF data gracefully.
  * Make capitalization of migration-assistant consistent (LP: #225555).
  * Remember hostname between runs of ubiquity (LP: #40590).
  * Disable the close button for progress windows (LP: #107686).
  * Reset stay_on_page when the back button is pressed (LP: #235374).

ubiquity (1.8.6) hardy; urgency=low

  [ Luke Yelavich ]
  * bin/ubiquity-dm:
    - Move code relating to at-spi-registryd to ensure that a11y is loaded
      before the background and window manager. (LP: #197887)
    - Ensure that orca/onboard are only run if the a11y gconf key is set.
    - Don't show any background image if the v1 profile is selected, similar to
      what happens in the GNOME desktop with this profile enabled.
    - Do not drop privileges when running the window manager,
      gnome-settings-daemon, or any of the a11y tools. Privileges are still
      dropped when accessibility is not enabled.
    - Wait for 15 seconds before loading orca, to let the a11y framework settle,
      and prevent orca from zombifying. This is a workaround until a cleaner
      solution is found.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Fix console-setup seen flag handling; console-setup/layout and
    console-setup/variant need to be marked unseen even in automatic mode so
    that they get their defaults set correctly, so use a different method to
    avoid displaying the question in preseeded installations (LP: #188492).
  * Fix partition_too_small check only to warn about partitions that are not
    free space, are not marked as "do not use", and are marked for use with
    a filesystem.

  * Move the map when the cursor is near an edge instead of whenever the
    cursor moves (LP: #214989, #195159).
  * Various fixes to the new tzmap.  Thanks Colin Watson.
    - Wait half a second before zooming in.
    - Zoom in from the position of the mouse, rather than the top left
      corner.
    - Widen the hover-to-move areas.
    - Find the closest hotspot if there are several nearby.
    - Zoom to 4.5x.
  * Removed 12system_partitions_formatted.  It now lives in partman-target.

  * Fix crash if opening /cdrom/.disk/info fails (with Jonathan and Evan).
  * Show current filesystem type if it isn't currently being used for
    anything; now that partman no longer sets up automatic mount points for
    everything, the lack of filesystem types made it difficult to get any
    context on which partition was which.
  * Set /apps/nautilus/preferences/media_autorun_never to true during

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Make all text in the partitioner translatable (LP: #144741).
    Unfortunately we don't have time to get translations in place for 8.04,
    but there ought to be time to do this for 8.04.1. This also involved
    moving the "Undo changes to partitions" button to a second line in order
    to avoid excessive horizontal growth.
  * Adjust po-debconf flags in ubiquity/install/copying_error/md5, so that
    ${FILE} doesn't get translated.
  * Offer a list of mount points when creating a partition (LP: #85713).
    Adjust this list (and also that offered when editing a partition) if the
    file system is changed to FAT or NTFS.
  * Guard against division by zero while copying files (LP: #211503).
  * Ensure that "Location for the new partition" always defaults to
    "Beginning" (LP: #207810).
  * Stop X forwarding code from breaking if we aren't running within X
    (LP: #214211).

  * Optimize the md5 check on file copy (LP: #198019).
  * Copy the locale over to the target system when using oem-config.
    This was previously fixed for the alternate CD in LP 181291.
  * Use + instead of : for a replacement character for m-a as it is
    explicitly allowed by debconf policy.
  * Break out of resizing the partition in cases where partman fed us bad
    boundary values (LP: #197838).
  * Don't miscalculate with nested partitions in 03partition_too_small (LP:
    #198039).
  * Automatic update of included source packages: apt-setup

  * Turn off console blanking in Ubiquity init script to prevent
    confusion on the noninteractive frontend.
  * Update mythbuntu ubiquity icon.

  * Fix crash if partitioning failed when partitioning was automated (see LP
    #206113).
  * Remove packages in the restricted section from the installed system if
    apt-setup/restricted is false.
  * Fix crash with the "don't use" partitioning option (LP: #132611).
  * Use localised, human-readable names for partitioning methods.

    handling.
  * Add a "Format the partition?" checkbox to the partition edit dialog

ubiquity (1.7.18) hardy; urgency=low

  [ Jonathan Riddell ]
  * kde_ui:
   - Enable/disable advanced partitioner buttons, don't hide/show
   - Use Oxygen icon and make it findable by KDE 4
   - Fix reboot dialogue to actually offer a reboot option
   - When clicking Back at AdvancedPartitioner, go back to first Partitioner page, not keyboard

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Move cancelButton.hide() to after setCancelButton in the KDE frontend as
    the latter function causes the button to be shown again.
  * Use a black border around tzmap points to assist the visually impaired.
  * Flash the currently selected location on the tzmap so that it's easier to
    spot.
  * When clicking on the tzmap, if the closest match is already selected, take
    the next closest.
  * Place the tzmap in an AspectFrame so it doesn't look distorted on
    widescreen displays (LP: #200152).

ubiquity (1.7.15) hardy; urgency=low

  [ Mario Limonciello ]
  * debian/control:
    - Make ubiquity-frontend-gtk depend on x-window-manager to prevent
      pulling in unnecessary window managers in Xubuntu and Mythbuntu.
      This shouldn't break anything since the Ubuntu seed explicitly
      depends upon metacity and Xubuntu upon xfwm4.
  * bin/ubiquity-dm:
    - Take command out of subprocess line for X to allow it to be started
      differently for different frontends.
  * Make VNC password readable.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * test -e fails on dangling symlinks; simply ignore errors when creating
    ~/.config/autostart/mythtv.desktop symlink, rather than trying to test
    for it in advance (LP: #197915).
  * Update imported translations from gtk+2.0 2.12.8-1.

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Overload get_oem_id in base frontend to avoid calling back into the
    frontend and trying to talk to debconf when the install process already
    has the database locked (LP: #198108).
  * Install oem-config-gtk in the noninteractive frontend when appropriate.

  * Enable debconf's escape capability for communications between the filter
    and the underlying frontend by default. Split arguments to filtered
    commands into only as many arguments as are required by the command.
    This should fix autopartitioning in certain locales (LP: #177623).
  * In ubiquity-dm, fall back to xfwm4 if metacity fails (unifying gtk_ui

    displays.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Prevent apt-install from installing packages directly unless
    install_extras has been run (previously, it would do so once apt was
    configured, which produced some confusing error messages).
  * Call apt-setup finish-install script during cleanup, not while
    configuring apt; removing cdrom entries from sources.list at this point
    broke OEM installs and probably other things (LP: #188240).
  * Fetch http_proxy and no_proxy from gconf (if possible) immediately
    before configuring apt.
  * Update installed file list for apt-setup 1:0.31ubuntu3.
  * GTK frontend:
    - Add proxy configuration to the advanced dialog (LP: #131421).
  * Import DebconfError correctly in summary component (thanks, Jesus L.
    Alvaro; LP: #177442).
  * Build-depend on dctrl-tools rather than grep-dctrl.

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Validate the boot device string that the user provides on the
    advanced page.
  * Change the boot device Entry to a ComboBox that displays suitable targets.
  * Updated the location of gnome-settings-daemon in ubiquity-dm.
  * Fix the installer window appearing briefly when starting automatic mode.
  * Explicitly call GDM/KDM at the end of ubiquity-dm as we now remove the rc
    files in casper for only-ubiquity and automatic-ubiquity.
  * Always show the advanced partitioner buttons, greying them out
    conditionally instead of hiding them.
  * Add the progress bar for automatic mode that was already present in
    gtk_ui to kde_ui.
  * Replace the resize slider with a custom widget in gtk_ui.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: apt-setup
    1:0.31ubuntu5, grub-installer 1.27ubuntu5, hw-detect 1.58ubuntu2,

    languagechooser/language-name-* (LP: #181440).

  * KDE frontend: Disable the KDE media notifier for the entire duration of
    installation (LP: #122500).
  * Rename gtk-ui to gtk_ui and kde-ui to kde_ui, to make it easier to
    subclass them.
  * If oem-config/enable is true, then:
    - Adjust title bar to indicate that Ubiquity is running in OEM mode.
    - Hardcode the user's full name to "OEM Configuration (temporary user)",
      the username to "oem", and the UID to 29999.
    - Install the appropriate oem-config-FRONTEND package on the target
      system.
    - Install a desktop file for oem-config-prepare on the oem user's
      desktop.
    - Ask for a unique identifier for this batch of installations, and save
      that in /var/log/installer/oem-id on the installed system.
  * Add a warning in d-i/source/README about modifying files in this
    directory.
  * GTK frontend:
    - Fix full-name error reason widget, and make the error reasons
      selectable.
    - Suppress some spurious uncaught exceptions on startup.
    - Don't reconfigure the username entry box as a combo box if
      migration-assistant didn't find any users.
  * Replicate the apt configuration done by base-installer (trust CD-ROMs,
    allow unauthenticated packages if debian-installer/allow_unauthenticated
    is true, bind-mount /cdrom into /target, and configure apt-cdrom/apt not

  * Make sure that the bounds of the spin button in the partition edit
    dialog always include the current size of the partition, even if for
    some reason it is outside the minimum/maximum resize ranges reported by

    - Fix crash if one of the placeholder continent entries is selected as
      the timezone (LP: #112813).
  * From the department of pickiness: PEP-8 import ordering.
  * Move .glade and .ui files to a new top-level gui directory in the source
    package. Install .ui files in /usr/share/ubiquity/qt rather than in
    /usr/lib/ubiquity/ubiquity/frontend now that they are loaded on the fly
    rather than being compiled into .py files statically.
  * If /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules exists, copy it rather than
    generating /etc/iftab.

  * Fix escaping of migration-assistant summary.
  * Only display partitions with scheduled migrations in the summary, and
    improve the formatting slightly.
  * Remove another stray newline from the migration-assistant summary.
  * GTK frontend:
    - Pressing Enter in the migration-assistant user/password entry boxes
      activates the Forward button.
    - Drop X-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=ubiquity in the .desktop file for now, to
      work around a bug somewhere that causes the translations in the
      .desktop file to be ignored in that case.
    - Disable thunar automounting during installation (LP: #107259).
  * Remove the old advanced partitioner.
  * Use code based on shutil.copyfileobj rather than shutil.copyfile to copy
    files, avoiding a couple of unnecessary stats due to os.path.samefile.
  * Remove netcloner, noui, and text frontends, which are too out-of-date at
    the moment even to be worth using as examples. A reimplementation would
    need to start from scratch anyway.
  * Rename gtkui frontend to gtk-ui to match kde-ui (which had to be named
    that way due to a clash with python-kde3).
  * Update some copyright dates.
  * Split out internationalisation code from ubiquity.misc into
    ubiquity.i18n.
  * Remove some dead code from ubiquity.misc.
  * Create a BaseFrontend class and move various things to it; it now counts
    as a relatively clear specification of what a frontend has to implement.
  * Reorder some frontend methods to follow the ordering of the UI.
  * Fix crash if partman exits while the create or edit dialog is being
    displayed (LP: #108204).
  * Reconfigure /etc/papersize on installation (LP: #104160).
  * When changing values of debconf questions in /target, make sure to shut
    down debconf-communicate even if the Python debconf confmodule raises an

  * Suppress error dialog if the user quits while a debconffiltered process
    is running.
  * New partitioner: If the user tries to change multiple attributes of a
    partition at once, look each item up in the partman menu in sequence
    rather than looking them all up at the start. This makes it possible
    e.g. to change the method from one that doesn't support a mountpoint to

  * Issue a debugging message any time a process exits, not just when it
    exits non-zero.
  * Disable migration-assistant if using the old partitioner: it crashes and
    is probably too much trouble to fix.
  * Avoid crashing in certain progressposition methods if no progress bar is
    running (LP: #51077).
  * Return to partitioning if you back up from partman-commit (LP: #78930).
  * Adjust ubiquity/text/partition_help, ubiquity/text/finished_label,

ubiquity (1.3.21) feisty; urgency=low

    - Try harder not to interfere with autopartitioning (LP: #84597).
    - Ignore parted exceptions presented with priority medium or below.

  * KDE frontend: Remove now-unused kde-distro-logo.png.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/ubiquity.install-any: Move apport package hook to
    /usr/share/apport/package-hooks/; this is where apport looks for them
    from 0.52 onwards.

ubiquity (1.3.19) feisty; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * New partitioner: Don't allow creating a disk label or creating, editing,
    or deleting a partition while other similar operations are in progress.
  * Display a warning message next to the password entry box if running in
    debug mode, since the password will then end up in the log file via
    debconf debugging.
  * Don't crash if /etc/X11/xorg.conf is unaccountably missing (LP: #83927).
  * Import translations for Cancel, Back, Forward etc. buttons from gtk+2.0
    2.10.9-0ubuntu1 (LP: #43915).
  * Automatic update of included source packages: apt-setup 1:0.16ubuntu3,
    migration-assistant 0.3.1, partman-auto 62ubuntu4,
    partman-basicfilesystems 51ubuntu1.

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Merged in migration-assistant work. Moved the user-setup page to after
    migration-assistant (and thus also after the partitioner, since
    migration-assistant needs to know which partitions are to be left
    intact). Made user-setup able to make use of users from
    migration-assistant.

ubiquity (1.3.18) feisty; urgency=low

  * New partitioner:
    - Disable the mountpoint combo box when creating or editing a partition
      if the method is changed to something other than a filesystem.
    - Handle partman/exception_handler and partman/exception_handler_note
      (LP: #82848).
    - Note that unadorned sizes are assumed to be in megabytes (LP: #82848).
    - Display current partition sizes in megabytes (part of LP: #83166).
    - Implement resizing. Ask for the size using a spinbutton (in megabytes)
      rather than a text entry field.
    - Offer 'fat16' and 'fat32' filesystem types for new partitions rather
      than the non-existent 'fat' (LP: #83211).
    - Fix crash when backing up to automatic partitioning page (LP: #83230).
  * doc/README: Add comment about language pack installation following a
    query from Telmo Baía.
  * Fix crash due to underqualification of debconf.DebconfError (thanks,
    Joel Bryan Juliano; LP: #83008).
  * Automatic update of included source packages: partman-partitioning
    45ubuntu1.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  1 Feb 2007 08:29:23 +0000

ubiquity (1.3.16) feisty; urgency=low

  * New partitioner: Fix a crash if the edit dialog is OKed with neither
    method nor mountpoint changed.
  * GTK frontend: Fix re-raising of exceptions to (a) work and (b) interact
    properly with apport's Python hook.
  * Quick hack to avoid updating the initramfs when calling
    console-setup.postinst from within ubiquity.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  1 Feb 2007 00:17:10 +0000

ubiquity (1.3.15) feisty; urgency=low

  * Add --old-partitioner command-line option to force the use of the old
    advanced partitioner even when it stops being the default. (Of course,
    this won't work for ever, as the old code will eventually be removed.)
  * GTK frontend: Disable gnome-volume-manager automounting for the entire
    duration of installation (LP: #78862).
  * Really install the apport hook.
  * Switch the new partitioner on by default. As above, use 'ubiquity
    --old-partitioner' to disable it.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 30 Jan 2007 14:10:11 +0000

ubiquity (1.3.14) feisty; urgency=low

  * Use partman-efi on i386.
  * Ship an apport hook instead of calling apport directly from the GTK
    frontend.
  * New partitioner: Skip telling partman to edit method or mountpoint if
    either is left unchanged in the edit dialog.
  * Copy value of popularity-contest/participate into /target (LP: #78972).
  * Automatic update of included source packages: console-setup 1.13ubuntu6,
    partman-auto 62ubuntu3.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Sun, 14 Jan 2007 02:08:57 +0000

ubiquity (1.3.11) feisty; urgency=low

  * New partitioner: Fix crash while setting up partition edit dialog.
  * New partitioner: Indent partition names two spaces to the right of disk
    names.
  * GTK frontend: Drop privileges while invoking gconftool-2, and point it
    at the correct user's gconf directory; this fixes incorrect automounting
    during partitioning.
  * Fix language pack installation to clean up any broken packages in the
    dependency cache more comprehensively (LP: #61912 and probably a slew of
    duplicates).
  * GTK frontend: Fix various obscure crashes with non-ASCII
    autopartitioning choices (LP: #78778).
  * Automatic update of included source packages: partman-base 100ubuntu2.

    than CDs/DVDs in doc/README.
  * Extend backporting FAQ in doc/README to cover issues with backporting
    from feisty.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: silo-installer
    1.07ubuntu2.
  * Track silo-installer 1.07ubuntu2 changes (install device2obp, tweak
    PATH).

  [ Jonathan Riddell ]
  * KDE frontend: Fix crash if release_notes_url_template is None.
  * KDE frontend: Fix crash when editing GRUB device name.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue,  9 Jan 2007 17:56:20 +0000

ubiquity (1.3.8) feisty; urgency=low

  * Depend on python-gtk2 (>= 2.10) for gtk.LinkButton.
  * Move GRUB configuration to a new Advanced... dialog, getting rid of the
    poor UI on the summary page (LP: #63073).
  * Add a popularity-contest participation checkbox to the advanced dialog
    (LP: #55637).
  * Reset hostname_edited (so that it will be automatically generated again)
    if the hostname entry box is emptied.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: console-setup 1.13ubuntu4.
  * Track console-setup 1.13ubuntu4 changes by generating and using
    MyKeyboardNames.pl based on xkb-data, which is more up to date than
    KeyboardNames.pl.

  * Remove "Set Time..." button, which is far more trouble than it's worth
    (LP: #49412, #52716, #52717, #73907, #76564). You can adjust the time
    after installation.
  * Fix a silly typo while setting up the resize progress bar (LP: #77523).
  * Don't say "beta version" in the alpha intro message.
  * Move language list box to the left-hand side of its page rather than the
    bottom, on the basis that you have to choose a language before you can
    read the text.
  * Switch to glade-3 (those with branches that modify ubiquity.glade, take
    note).
  * Add special cases to restore correct handling of Chinese and Portuguese
    language codes.
  * If /cdrom/.disk/release_notes_url is present, display a link to the
    release notes on the language page. See doc/README for the format
    (https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/ubiquity-release-notes).
  * Remove no-longer-canonical /distros from Launchpad URLs.
  * Sync up hostname handling with netcfg; it now allows hostnames between 2
    and 63 characters in length, forbids them starting or ending with a
    hyphen, and interprets hostnames containing dots as hostname.domain and
    adjusts /etc/hosts accordingly (LP: #52501, #72909).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed,  3 Jan 2007 13:59:25 +0000

ubiquity (1.3.6) feisty; urgency=low

  * Avoid use of super() in components, since it's far too confusing.
  * I managed to create two different PartmanAuto.error() methods by
    mistake. Merge them.
  * GTK frontend: If a question asked by a component doesn't have a message
    for the dialog body, set it to the title as that's better than nothing.
  * GTK frontend: First cut at the new advanced partitioner. The graphical
    disk view isn't implemented yet, many features are missing, validation
    probably doesn't work properly, and it's very slow, but I hope all these
    issues can be worked out in time. Use 'ubiquity --new-partitioner' to
    try it out.

ubiquity (1.3.5) feisty; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Move the ubiquity executable proper into /usr/lib/ubiquity/bin, and add
    a /usr/bin/ubiquity wrapper that calls gksudo, kdesu, etc. as
    appropriate. This makes argument handling more straightforward and
    reduces the need for strange environment variables.
  * Add command-line option handling: --debug is equivalent to the old
    UBIQUITY_DEBUG environment variable, while --cdebconf is new (and
    experimental). Combined with the above change, this means that the
    clumsy and frontend-dependent 'gksudo env UBIQUITY_DEBUG=1 ubiquity' or
    'kdesu --nonewdcop env UBIQUITY_DEBUG=1 ubiquity' invocations can be
    replaced with just 'ubiquity --debug'.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: choose-mirror 2.10ubuntu1.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * GTK frontend: Port the apport crash handler to new API of apport 0.33
    (apport_utils/problem_report modules -> apport python package). Depend
    on python-apport now instead of the old modules.

ubiquity (1.3.4) feisty; urgency=low

  * apt-install only attempts to install packages not already installed,
    making it more robust when packages on the target filesystem are broken
    (LP: #74241).
  * KDE frontend: Don't infinite-loop on EOF from qtparted (LP: #67565).
  * Make sure localechooser doesn't clobber the selected country if it
    differs from the default (LP: #68026).
  * Add a check-manifest tool to ensure that d-i/manifest is in sync with
    d-i/source/ on upload.
  * Upgrade to automake 1.10.
  * Configure and build the desktop, pixmaps, and po subdirectories even if
    UBIQUITY_NO_GTK is set.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: apt-setup 1:0.16ubuntu2,

  * GTK frontend: Work around disappearing input focus on intro page.
  * GTK frontend: Activate Forward button when a row in the language or
    keyboard treeviews is activated.
  * Remove use of dh_python, since it's a no-op now. Bump debhelper
    build-dependency to 5.0.37.3ubuntu2 (a.k.a. dh_python from 5.0.38) for
    this.
  * KDE frontend: Remove tabstop for new_size_scale from .ui file, since
    that widget doesn't exist there any more.
  * KDE frontend: Fix logo image widgets to take account of removed disk
    page.
  * KDE frontend: Fix various crashes in set_autopartition_choices due to
    botched use of Qt.

  * KDE frontend: Treat more user-entered strings as Unicode rather than

  * KDE frontend: Hide auto-resize frame rather than merely disabling it.
  * KDE frontend: Use a single progress bar for all copy and configuration
    steps.
  * KDE frontend: Disable going back or forward once the install progress
    bar is up. (Why is the main window still visible at this point, anyway?)
  * Fix mount point validation to avoid accidentally skipping a number of
    checks on pre-existing partitions, including the "is there a root file
    system?" check (closes: Malone #67130).
  * GTK frontend: Include zoom-in.png in ubiquity-frontend-gtk so that the
    magnifying glass cursor is displayed on the timezone page (closes:

  * Drop support for old ESPRESSO_DEBUG environment variable.
  * Add an intro message noting that we're alpha again.
  * Save /target/var/lib/dpkg/status to
    /target/var/log/installer/initial-status.gz; suggested by Jason
    Whitlark.
  * Remove a bunch of unnecessary imports noticed by pyflakes, and add a
    couple of missing ones.
  * Account for a new file shipped by grub-installer.

  * GTK frontend: Avoid calling gtk.main_quit if a main loop isn't running,
    as further insurance against Malone #54163.
  * Fix various bugs when mounting source filesystems natively rather than
    relying on casper to have mounted them already (closes: Malone #64348).
  * Automatic update of included source packages: debian-installer-utils

  * Catch ENOENT, EIO, ENOTDIR, and EROFS while copying files, try to figure
    out what filename they relate to, and display a useful error message
    explaining that this is probably a CD or hard disk fault (as
    appropriate) and how to deal with this. Closes about a million bugs.

ubiquity (1.1.26) edgy; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Build-depend on po-debconf (>= 1.0) for new translation-handling
    features.
  * Add a FAQ about backporting to doc/README.
  * Document ubiquity/install/filesystem-images in doc/README.
  * autogen.sh: Force use of automake-1.8 and aclocal-1.8.
  * Move auxiliary autotools files to a build subdirectory.
  * Add a check to debian/rules to remind me to bump the version number in
    configure.ac.
  * Read partition flags from gparted (>= 0.2.5-1.1ubuntu9). Display an
    error on the mountpoints page if running on powerpc and there is no HFS
    partition with the boot flag set. Treat HFS partitions with the boot
    flag set as NewWorld bootstrap partitions (closes: Malone #43768).
  * GTK frontend: Add a keyboard variant selector (closes: Malone #61729).
    (The same needs to be done for the KDE frontend.)
  * Remove old kbd-chooser component, which won't be usable any more.
  * Send stderr to /var/log/installer/debug if UBIQUITY_DEBUG is set.
  * Send DEBCONF_DEBUG=filter output to stderr, not syslog; it should be
    interleaved with DEBCONF_DEBUG=developer output.
  * GTK frontend: Throw away stderr from gnome-screensaver-command; it
    outputs far too much rubbish and confuses users.
  * KDE frontend: Fix reboot dialog button handling (closes: Malone #62765).
  * Replace the rather jittery time-remaining message while copying files
    with a message that appears when there's less than a minute remaining
    (closes: Malone #61514).

    starting console-setup, to avoid incorrect variant choices (although I
    think there's also a console-setup bug here in that the variants are
    being substituted in the wrong order).

    capability is set (closes: Malone #48005).
  * Don't crash if a progress bar is set up to have the same start and end
    points (closes: Malone #56789).
  * Fix timezone component to deal with frontend.get_timezone returning None
    (closes: Malone #42865).
  * Use more sensible default cities for languages with country shortlists
    (i.e. the intended default rather than the first in alphabetical order
    of country code), working around a missing feature in debconf.
  * Pick a sensible default city for countries with multiple zones but no
    explicit default city (closes: Malone #43914).
  * Remove obsolete Recommends: gparted from ubiquity; ubiquity-frontend-gtk
    already depends on it.
  * Feed not-yet-formatted partition state back into gparted when starting
    it up, so that newly-created partitions aren't listed as "unknown" when
    you go back (requires gparted 0.2.5-1.1ubuntu8; closes: Malone #40404).
  * Fix use of gobject.spawn_async in
    gnome-screensaver-command/xscreensaver-command, broken in 1.1.19.
  * Make sure that "Restart now" is the default option on the final dialog
    (closes: Malone #61517).
  * Log warnings in various cases when partitions are ignored on the
    mountpoints page.
  * GTK frontend: For some reason GtkTable doesn't seem to queue a resize
    itself when you attach children to it, so the mountpoints table was
    showing up blank the first time through. Worked around this.
  * Add/update translations from Rosetta: Arabic, Belarusian, Bulgarian,
    Breton, Danish, German, Greek, Spanish, Basque, Finnish, French, Hindi,
    Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Georgian, Korean, Kurdish, Latvian,
    Nepali, Norwegian Nynorsk, Occitan, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian,

    POSIX semantics are required (closes: Malone #48410).
  * GTK frontend: Scroll the mount points table if required (closes: Malone
    #51796).
  * Ignore failures from os.utime on directories. I don't know why I get a
    disproportionate number of reports of this failing, but to be honest I
    don't care enough about directory timestamps to investigate.
  * Add trivial pid file locking, allowing ubiquity to exit gracefully if
    you try to run more than one instance of it at once; previously it blew
    up much more spectacularly upon finding that the debconf database was
    locked (closes: Malone #46569).
  * Run gnome-screensaver-command/xscreensaver-command with LC_ALL=C to

    from Breezy.
  * Move from kbd-chooser to console-setup
    (https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/sane-installer-keyboard). We
    still need to add a UI element for the keyboard variant, and
    translations of layout and variant names are missing, but it mostly
    seems to work.
  * Strip Fonts and Keyboard directories from our copy of console-setup;
    they're very large, and not needed since we don't actually build
    console-setup, but just copy a few scripts from it.
  * Add a ubiquity/install/filesystem-images template, which can be
    preseeded to mount and copy a different filesystem image. If multiple
    space-separated images are given, then they will be overlaid using
    unionfs
    (https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/live-cd-stacked-filesystems).
  * Unset DEBIAN_HAS_FRONTEND in apt-install to make sure that debconf-using

  * Install apt-setup cdrom generator.
  * Send all log messages to syslog rather than stderr. Use log-output from
    di-utils for external processes where necessary.
  * Remove several obsolete functions from ubiquity.misc.
  * Fix misc.ex to use subprocess.call properly rather than smashing
    arguments together and invoking them via the shell.
  * Remove duplicate logging from Install.chrex.
  * Remove /var/log/installer/syslog from all error messages etc., as
    everything goes to /var/log/syslog now. /var/log/syslog is now copied to
    /var/log/installer/syslog on the target system.
  * Automatically set UBIQUITY_NO_GTK or UBIQUITY_NO_KDE to disable building
    frontends as appropriate if tools are missing (pygtk-codegen-2.0 for the
    GTK frontend, kdepyuic for the KDE frontend). This should never happen
    in normal builds, but saves typing when building test versions.
  * Teach DebconfFilter to send escaped replies when CAPB escape is set.
  * Fix substitution variable for full name in ubiquity/summary.
  * I never really understood the whole control flow around the summary
    page, and I wrote it! Take advantage of the partman-commit script added
    in partman-base 90ubuntu4, so that instead we shut down partman, run the
    summary page, and then start it back up to commit changes. The
    PartmanCommit component is now used for both automatic and manual
    partitioning, and is simply called directly from progress_loop; and the
    Summary component no longer needs to be run with a temporary debconf
    database.
  * Configure locales and the user account before running target-config

  * Work around weirdness regarding some partitions going missing from
    part_labels/part_devices in frontends. The right fix is probably to
    update part_labels/part_devices with information from gparted/qtparted,

    rename it to ubiquity.glade.
  * Update debian/copyright regarding the status of Ubiquity with respect to

  * When an error occurs with the install progress bar up, only return to

  * Turn DebconfInstallProgress upside-down so that the main process handles
    apt installation and the subprocess handles the translation of apt
    status messages into debconf protocol messages, rather than the other
    way round. The previous approach resulted in exceptions from apt ending

  * Remove /usr/bin/espresso compatibility symlink.
  * Use os._exit() rather than sys.exit() in the apt install progress child

  * Turn internal (non-debconf) debugging on by default; it can be disabled
    by setting UBIQUITY_DEBUG_CORE=0. Debconf debugging is unfortunately not
    safe to enable by default because it logs the user's password.
  * Write out /target/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/00IgnoreTimeConflict for the

  * Make for loops in debian/rules exit properly on errors.
  * Allow defining UBIQUITY_NO_GTK or UBIQUITY_NO_KDE during the build to
    avoid making use of GTK- or KDE-specific build-dependencies
    (respectively). This is useful to cut down on the number of
    build-dependencies needed when testing on a live CD.
  * If ubiquity is started with no arguments, try both the gtkui and kde-ui
    frontends rather than just gtkui.
  * Explicitly return Unicode strings from ubiquity.misc.get_string(),
    simplifying the KDE frontend.
  * Add a no-op anna-install shim for localechooser, ensuring that locales
    are generated.
  * Ignore errors from locale.setlocale(), although with the above
    anna-install fix I hope this should not often be necessary (closes:
    Malone #41132).

  * GTK and KDE frontends:
    - Make the determination of whether to allow going forward from the user
      information page a bit more reliable.
  * Remove gettext use from ubiquity.misc.part_label(); we'll make those
    translatable via debconf in the future, but for now this breaks the KDE
    frontend.

    (under d-i/source/), build them as part of our build process, and
    include all the components in the espresso binary package. 'debian/rules
    update' can be used to do automatic updates of these copied source
    packages. This should ultimately simplify maintenance work as well as
    making it much easier for third parties to make local changes to this

espresso (0.99.30) dapper; urgency=low

  * GTK frontend:
    - Move partitioning committal into the main installation progress bar.
  * Remove text resizing based on the screen size, which as well as being
    annoying was also implemented in a way that made our lives difficult for
    internationalisation.
  * Add internationalisation support for those strings that don't come from
    d-i, with translations stored in debconf templates. I've only set this
    up in the GTK frontend so far, but it should be straightforward to do
    elsewhere. Requires espresso-locale (>= 0.27ubuntu11).
  * Improve the final dialog text.

espresso (0.99.29) dapper; urgency=low

  * Fix variable/method name clash in Install's apt error handling.
  * GTK frontend:
    - Rename "Adjust..." to "Set Time...".
    - Remove justification text on location page; instead, add brief
      instructions at the top. Rename "Nearest city" to "Selected city".
    - Make the password entry boxes smaller.
    - Change the summary text box to a selectable label so that it gets the
      standard dialog background colour. Add padding around the text.
  * Change permissions of log file in /target to 600 to guard against any
    possible leakage of sensitive data.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 14 Mar 2006 13:46:49 +0000

espresso (0.99.28) dapper; urgency=low

  * GTK frontend:
    - Add an "Adjust..." button on the timezone screen which starts
      time-admin to let you change the current time.
  * Make espresso-gtkui.desktop use sudo for now, to work around gksudo
    breakage on the live CD. This means we rely on the live CD having
    passwordless sudo.

espresso (0.99.27) dapper; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * GTK frontend:
    - Set initial Forward button text in glade rather than in code.
    - Change Forward button to say "Install" when on the summary page.
    - Revamp identification page layout. Add callbacks to let user-setup
      tell us about errors on this page more accurately.
  * KDE frontend:
    - Add guesswork/stub implementations for set_fullname(), set_username(),
      username_error(), and password_error(), for use by user-setup.

  [ Daniel Silverstone ]
  * Make sure GTK gparted integration supports the new gparted.

espresso (0.99.26) dapper; urgency=low

  * GTK frontend:
    - Add a test box to the keymap page. (Note that your keymap isn't
      actually changed in the installer at the moment, so this won't work
      yet.)
    - Display the current time in the format used by the currently-selected
      locale.
  * GTK and KDE frontends:
    - Move the keymap page after the location page, so that in future the
      keymap page can be initialised using data for the selected country.
  * Make espresso.tz.SystemTzInfo.dst() pretend that DST is not in effect if
    we have no DST information, rather than returning the more correct None;
    this allows fromutc() to be used reliably.
  * Use espresso-yaboot to install yaboot on powerpc systems.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  9 Mar 2006 08:32:42 +0000

espresso (0.99.25) dapper; urgency=low

  * GTK frontend:
    - Add a format checkbox to the mountpoints page (closes: Malone #32065).
      Requires partman (>= 78ubuntu1+8).
  * Patched up KDE frontend to avoid breaking it too badly (I hope) until
    corresponding UI is added there too.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed,  8 Mar 2006 14:59:41 +0000

espresso (0.99.24) dapper; urgency=low

  * Fix espresso.tz.SystemTzInfo to work for datetime.datetime.now(tzinfo).
  * GTK frontend:
    - Improve headings and spacing on advanced partitioning pages.
    - Remove more text that claims /home will not be formatted.
    - Rearrange help text on advanced partitioning pages to allow for more
      space on the screen where it matters.
    - Show the current time in the selected timezone on the location page.
    - Translate more strings from Spanish to English.
    - Use HH:MM for UTC offsets rather than fractions of hours.
    - Refer to UTC offsets as GMT offsets instead; it's not quite 100%
      accurate, but (we think) more widely understood.
    - Add a border around the timezone map.
    - Change identification page heading to "Who are you?".
    - Reorganise locale page so that the language select box is in the
      middle rather than at the left-hand side, and shorter.
    - Drop the notebook border.
    - Remove the expander and the "Details" label from the summary page, per
      feedback from the UI sprint.
    - Make the first click on the timezone map zoom in but not select a
      city; the second click will select a city.
  * KDE frontend:
    - Add get_mountpoints method, needed by partman.
  * Remove old Guadalinex screenshots.
  * Remove *.pyc and *.pyo on 'debian/rules clean'.

  * Improve the appearance of several pages a bit.
  * Automatically scroll language and keymap lists so that the selected
    option is visible.
  * Fix backup handling in GTK frontend (closes: Malone #32866).
  * Allow cancelling installation by closing the window (closes: Malone
    #32865).
  * Catch IOError while downloading language packs.
  * Put back get_mountpoints methods in frontends, as partman needs them.

espresso (0.99.21) dapper; urgency=low

  [ Tollef Fog Heen ]
  * Allow prepare() methods in components to have access to the debconf
    database.
  * Add FilteredCommand.choices_display_map helper.
  * Flesh out keymap page, using espresso-keyboard-setup.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Sort presented list of keymaps.
  * Various pychecker-induced cleanups.
  * Make sure that stdout from language pack maintainer scripts doesn't
    interfere with Install's debconf protocol stream, and that a new debconf
    frontend is started for them in the target system.
  * Add set_fullname() and set_username() methods to the GTK frontend for
    use by user-setup.
  * Stop the installation progress bar on all return paths from
    Install.run().
  * Remove packages specific to the live CD after installation (relies on
    having a desktop manifest for the live filesystem from the buildd, which
    isn't done yet). Record packages that are dynamically installed and make
    sure we don't remove those.
  * Depend on python-apt.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  2 Mar 2006 13:33:51 +0000

espresso (0.99.20) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add support for cancellable progress bars.
  * The Copy/Config split is more inconvenient than useful, so merge the two
    steps into one, called simply Install.
  * Install language packs according to the selected language.

espresso (0.99.19) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add accessor methods to the GTK frontend for use by user-setup.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 28 Feb 2006 14:34:44 +0000

espresso (0.99.18) dapper; urgency=low

  * Rip all the /target unmounting code out of espresso.backend.copy and do
    it in the main espresso program just before exiting.
  * Parse /proc/mounts for mountpoints to unmount; this saves having to have
    a get_mountpoints method in every frontend.
  * Unmount /target before starting the frontend, since we will behave badly
    if /target is still mounted from a previous installation attempt.

  * Handle all PROGRESS commands entirely in debconffilter, without passing
    them through to the debconf frontend.
  * Add a PROGRESS REGION extension to debconffilter, and a ProgressPosition
    class to keep track of progress bar regions; allows a single progress
    bar to be subdivided into pieces for different stages.
  * Hack FilteredCommand.run_command() to execute the command without any
    debconffiltering glue if frontend is None; this allows nested
    FilteredCommands to more or less work.
  * Stop FilteredCommand.error() from running a UI loop; we assume that the
    frontend's error_dialog() method runs synchronously.

  * Move espresso/components/summary to a new scripts directory.
  * Rework copy and configuration progress bars using debconffilter. This
    fixes some responsiveness bugs, allows for localisation, and finally
    unifies all progress bar handling.
  * Add debconf template translation boilerplate.

  * Move call_gparted from espresso.backend.part into the GTK frontend, as
    it's widget-set-dependent. Unhardcode the path to gparted.
  * Remove espresso/backend/, none of which is used any more except by the
    netcloner and noui frontends which are both broken at the moment anyway.
    The frontend/backend division is now between espresso.frontend and
    espresso.components, mediated by debconffilter.

  * Make espresso-frontend-gtk Architecture: any, due to the Evolution map
    widget (closes: Malone #32874).
  * Build Evolution map widget and Python bindings with -fPIC; should fix
    build failure on amd64.
  * Only enable the TimezoneMap.flash_selected_point handler when the
    timezone map is visible.
  * Remove text that claims /home will not be formatted; partly fixes Malone
    #32534.
  * Display an error dialog on GRUB installation failures (closes: Malone
    #32047; grub has been seeded, so this shouldn't generally happen any
    more anyway).
  * Notice and exit on errors from the copy and configuration stages.
  * Run 'make distclean' rather than 'make clean' on 'debian/rules clean'.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 27 Feb 2006 14:22:15 +0000

espresso (0.99.17) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add X-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=espresso to espresso-gtkui.desktop (although
    it's useless until we get internationalisation set up properly).
  * Open /var/log/installer/espresso with line-buffering so that error
    messages appear there more quickly during testing.
  * Fix debconffilter to handle SET and SUBST commands whose values consist
    of more than one word.
  * Add a "Ready to install" summary page. (It doesn't contain all the
    necessary information yet, and it should run before partitioning is
    committed rather than after, but that will be easy to fix later.)
  * In the GTK frontend, display an error dialog and exit if running as
    non-root.
  * Restore some bits of autoconfiscation that bzr helped me lose.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 24 Feb 2006 14:44:28 +0000

espresso (0.99.16) dapper; urgency=low

  * Explicitly decode strings returned by debconf as UTF-8, since apparently
    we get confused when running with the KDE frontend otherwise (which
    presumably does something funky with Python's default encoding).
  * Rename Changelog to Changelog.Guadalinex to avoid confusion. Ubuntu
    changes (i.e. everything since renaming to espresso) go here.
  * Add e-map widget, cut-and-pasted from evolution via gnome-system-tools
    (ugh).
  * Basic autoconfiscation for the above.
  * Add initial Python bindings for e-map.
  * Add an espresso.tz module for various bits of timezone handling.
  * First cut at timezone map widget, based on a translation of code in
    gnome-system-tools into Python. Depend on espresso-timezone.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 23 Feb 2006 13:26:13 +0000

espresso (0.99.15) dapper; urgency=low

  * Redirect sys.stderr to /var/log/installer/espresso so that we have a
    better chance of diagnosing problems after the fact.
  * Add FilteredCommand.value_index helper from oem-config.
  * Add support for components optionally returning a third argument from
    FilteredCommand.prepare(), interpreted as a dictionary of extra
    environment variables to set for the subprocess.
  * Add a language page, using espresso-locale. The locale is set in the
    target system and used for debconf coprocesses, although not yet for
    translatable strings in the Espresso core.
  * Add a FilteredCommand.cleanup() hook that can be overridden by
    components to perform cleanup tasks after their subprocess exits.
  * Stop logging every single file we copy to /var/log/installer/espresso;
    it creates massive log bloat and isn't very useful.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 21 Feb 2006 13:12:13 +0000

espresso (0.99.14) dapper; urgency=low

  * Set NoDisplay=true in espresso-gtkui.desktop so that it doesn't show up

    espresso not install itself on the target system.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 17 Feb 2006 18:40:10 +0000

espresso (0.99.13) dapper; urgency=low

  * Remove the GTK frontend's reliance on step numbers entirely; refer to
    widget names for each step instead. This makes it easier to add steps.
  * Fix the GTK frontend's reboot button.
  * Remove fstab configuration; partman does all this now, and trying to do
    it ourselves breaks in the autopartitioning case.
  * Make sure to block in progress_loop() until the final dialog has
    finished, rather than continuing and (in some cases) trying to re-run
    the partitioner.

espresso (0.99.12) dapper; urgency=low

  [ Tollef Fog Heen ]
  * Use named constants rather than just numbers for the steps in gtkui.py
  * Move the common parts (logo, photo and breadcrumb) outside the
    notebook so they don't have to be kept in sync.  Adjust code to
    highlight the correct one.
  * Use named constants instead of just numbers which make inserting new
    steps in the beginning possible.
  * Begin implementing a keyboard selector.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Stop destroying the browser widget; following Tollef's changes, this
    changes the number of pages in the notebook, causing much confusion.
  * Use named constants in espresso.validation; construct returned list more
    sensibly.
  * Hide the disk selector until it becomes useful.
  * More PEP 8 reformatting, this time in espresso.misc.
  * Fix 'espresso <frontend-name>' not to try to do two installs.
  * Provide a .desktop file for the GTK frontend.
  * Remove Guadalinex-specific text from warning and abort dialogs.

espresso (0.99.11) dapper; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Stop auto-hiding the panel when running the GTK frontend.
  * Stop logging how much time was spent in the installation; it makes it
    unnecessarily painful to quit espresso if you try to run it as non-root.
  * Get rid of the confirmation checkbox for automatic partitioning; partman
    pops up a more detailed confirmation dialog for this now.
  * Make ESPRESSO_DEBUG=1 imply DEBCONF_DEBUG='developer|filter' for ease of
    debugging.
  * Stop building espresso-frontend-cloner, espresso-guadalinex-artwork, and
    espresso-guadalinex-doc for now, until they work again and are
    better-tested.

  [ Tollef Fog Heen ]
  * Global reformatting to conform roughly to PEP 8 rather than a mish-mash
    of difficult-to-read styles.

  * Remove all the screenshots. We'll replace these with an animated demo
    when that's ready.
  * Avoid broken-image icons if logo or photo images aren't available.
  * Hardcode a list of valid debconf commands in debconffilter and ignore
    any we don't recognise. Works around most problems with multi-line
    commands in partman for now.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 14 Feb 2006 21:58:54 +0000

espresso (0.99.9) dapper; urgency=low

  * Drop on_key_press handler from GTK frontend; setting has_default on the
    Next button is cleaner, and having both that and a keypress handler
    breaks things.
  * Add a non-blocking mode to debconffilter, and watch the filter's input
    from the GTK main loop. This allows the GTK user interface to update
    while waiting for debconf commands.
  * Log errors from user-setup-apply and grub-installer, although for now
    it's unnecessarily painful to actually display them to the user.
  * Reduce log noise in configuration stage.
  * Try to disable gnome-volume-manager's automounting while mounting
    partitions.
  * Use the new stdio control interface in gparted 0.1-0ubuntu2 to apply
    changes when going forward from the manual partitioning screen, undo
    changes when going backward, and clean up gparted properly in either
    case. Make sure to relaunch gparted when required, as we can now launch
    it more than once.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 14 Feb 2006 16:06:00 +0000

espresso (0.99.8) dapper; urgency=low

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri,  3 Feb 2006 16:13:43 +0000

espresso (0.99.6) dapper; urgency=low

  * Initial work on porting to cdebconf (for speed and for increased
    compatibility with d-i), not enabled by default yet until I've had a
    chance to give it more testing.
  * Don't display paths while copying the filesystem; it will cause a lot of
    flickering when we make the counter update more often, and paths that
    are only updated at semi-random points every few seconds during the
    copying process are more confusing than interesting.
  * Fix apt-install to install packages in /target, not /.
  * Update the GTK interface much more frequently during the copying and
    configuration processes.
  * Fix various focus and default-dialog-action settings in the GTK
    interface.
  * Pad out the text in the debconf progress dialog a bit more.
  * Refactor DebconfFilter.run() into several pieces.

espresso (0.99.1) dapper; urgency=low

  * Rename to espresso to avoid confusion caused by somebody other than
    Ubuntu being upstream for a project called "Ubuntu ...", to reduce
    awkward branding considerations, and to clearly separate the work being
    done on this project for Dapper from the work done by Guadalinex since
    the focus is rather different.
  * Change Maintainer to me.
  * Rename lib directory in source to espresso so that pychecker can be used
    more easily.
  * Log to /var/log/installer/espresso instead of /var/log/<distro>-express.
  * Change all uses of express/* debconf questions to real questions where
    possible, and espresso/* where not.

  * Add debconffilter.py from oem-config (this has been sent to debconf
    upstream and may eventually make it in there instead). We'll use this
    for d-i integration.
  * Adjust debconffilter to filter out STOP.
  * Add generic error question handling, METAGET filtering, SUBST filtering,
    and PROGRESS filtering to debconffilter.
  * Ignore unknown commands in debconffilter, since some programs (hi,
    partman!) use multi-line commands despite them only working in cdebconf
    by fluke.
  * Add debconfcommunicator.py too; it's been committed to debconf upstream,
    but it's useful here anyway for backports to breezy.
  * Add rudimentary FilteredCommand class, a convenience wrapper around
    DebconfFilter that makes it easier to test various things.
  * Add filtered debconf progress bar handling in the GTK frontend.

  * Add apt-install and udpkg compatibility shims.
  * Call user-setup as a debconffilter coprocess while running the
    corresponding UI step, replacing our own duplicated validation code.
  * Call partman as a debconffilter coprocess while running the
    autopartitioning UI step. Remove peez2 entirely, as this will replace it
    once it's finished.
  * Change gparted invocation to use new --installer=WID option.
  * Replace hand-rolled partition formatting and mounting code with a call
    to PartmanCommit.
  * Copy from /rofs if it exists, rather than hunting through the CD for the
    filesystem image. Requires casper 1.25.
  * Run hook scripts in /usr/lib/espresso/target-config (filenames
    containing '.' are ignored) so that casper can propagate appropriate
    parts of its configuration to the target system.
  * Remove all references to base-config; timezone configuration now
    requires a .deb of the new tzsetup.
  * Use espresso-grub for GRUB installation rather than doing it by hand.
  * Drop dependency on yaboot | grub.

  * Refer to ubuntu.com everywhere, not the deprecated ubuntulinux.org.
  * Don't use full-screen mode.
  * Don't keep the GTK user interface window on top; it's annoying during
    development, and arguable at best in production.
  * Remove the numbers from the breadcrumb trail at the top of the screen.
  * Disable embedded web browser for now since this segfaults in current
    dapper (Bugzilla #20338). For the time being, replace it with a scary
    message telling users to be sure to BACK UP THEIR DATA FIRST.
  * Translate strings in glade file and progress queue messages to English.
    In the unlikely event that any of the strings remain basically
    identical, I'll restore the original text as a Spanish translation.
  * In general, don't send a progress queue message when completing a task,
    only when starting one. There's no point constructing translatable text
    that's only going to be on the screen for tiny fractions of a second
    anyway.
  * Strip newlines from lines in messages.txt.
  * Get rid of almost-useless help button. In general, the UI should be made
    self-explanatory rather than requiring extra clicks to get at help
    information.

  * Fix Config.get_locales() using DebconfCommunicator.
  * Try fetching timezone from /etc/localtime as well as from /etc/timezone.
  * Handle missing keymap and/or locale debconf questions.
  * Fix kernel version detection.
  * Use 'lsb_release -is' rather than reading /etc/lsb-release directly.
  * Depend on lsb-release.
  * Don't preselect a mount point for /home.
  * Fix unmounting at end of installation.
  * Remove ubuntu-express wrapper script; eventually we'll do whatever
    unmounting is necessary during the partitioning step rather than turning
    off swap for the whole installer (and partman should help with this
    already).
  * Install installer script as /usr/bin/espresso rather than
    /usr/bin/installer.
  * Quieten cpio a bit.

  * Use dh_installdocs to install documentation.
  * Remove unnecessary ${shlibs:Depends} dependencies.
  * Fix broken use of debhelper; the author seemed to be confusing -A and
    -a, and in any case we only build architecture-independent packages.
  * Use dh_install instead of verbose code in debian/rules (which includes a
    bashism anyway).
  * Remove hardcoded svn commands in generate-doc.sh.
  * Remove svn exclusion stuff in debian/rules; if building from a
    Subversion checkout, you should use standard workarounds to avoid .svn
    directories.
  * Remove generated source code documentation for now; it's really not
    terribly useful, certainly not in the espresso binary package, and
    ultimately it should be generated as part of the build process if at
    all.
  * Rewrite descriptions to be better English and (I hope) more useful.
